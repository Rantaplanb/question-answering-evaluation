 Γιώργο, καλημέρα.

Φεύγω στη δουλειά. Γυρίζω στις έξι το απόγευμα αλλά τα μαγαζιά είναι κλειστά. Γι΄ αυτό, σε παρακαλώ, να αγοράσεις μερικά πράγματα.
Δίπλα στο σπίτι, στα αριστερά, είναι ο κρεοπώλης. Να αγοράσεις ένα κιλό μπριζόλες και ένα κοτόπουλο.
Απέναντι είναι ο φούρνος. Χρειαζόμαστε ένα κιλό ψωμί. Να ζητήσεις να το βάλουν σε χάρτινη, όχι πλαστική σακούλα.
Λίγο πιο πέρα, στα δεξιά, βρίσκεται ο μανάβης. Έχει πάντοτε φρέσκα λαχανικά. Να πάρεις ένα κιλό ντομάτες για σαλάτα, δύο αγγουράκια και ένα κιλό πράσινα μήλα.
Ακριβώς δίπλα στο μανάβη είναι δύο ζαχαροπλαστεία. Να πας σε αυτό με την κόκκινη πόρτα. Ψωνίζω πάντοτε από εκεί. Έχει τέλεια γλυκά! Να πάρεις μια τούρτα με σοκολάτα για τα γενέθλια της Ελένης. Θα πάμε το βράδυ σπίτι της.

Νίκος

Goodmorning George.

I'm leaving at work. I turn at six in the afternoon but the shops are closed. That's why, please, buy a few things.
Next to the house, on the left, is the butcher. To buy a kilo steaks and a chicken.
Opposite is the oven. We need a kilogram of bread. To ask to put it in a paper, not a plastic bag.
A little further, on the right, is the grocery store. It always has fresh vegetables. Take a kilo tomatoes for salad, two cucumbers and a kilo green apples.
Right next to the granule is two patisseries. To go to it with the red door. Shop always from there. It's perfect sweets! Take a chocolate cake for Helen's birthday. We're going to get her night home.

Πολλοί νέοι το καλοκαίρι δεν κάνουν διακοπές. Δουλεύουν για ένα ή δύο μήνες.
Έχουμε κοντά μας το Γιάννη, τη Μυρτώ, τον Αλέκο και τη Σοφία. Θα μιλήσουμε για την εργασία το καλοκαίρι. Ας αρχίσουμε από τον Αλέκο.
-Γεια σας. Εγώ δουλεύω κάθε καλοκαίρι από το 2010. Ο θείος μου έχει μία πιτσαρία σε ένα νησί, τη Σκύρο. Κάνω διακοπές και κερδίζω χρήματα.
-Με λένε Μυρτώ. Τα καλοκαίρια βοηθάω τη μητέρα μου στο χωράφι. Βγάζουμε ντομάτες.
-Είμαι ο Γιάννης. Μου αρέσουν τα αυτοκίνητα. Ο μπαμπάς μου έχει ένα συνεργείο. Το καλοκαίρι είμαι βοηθός του.
-Το όνομά μου είναι Σοφία. Φτιάχνω ωραία βραχιόλια και κολιέ. Η θεία μου έχει μαγαζί και τα πουλάει.

Γεια σου Νίκο,

Τι κάνεις; Εγώ είμαι πολύ καλά. Έχω ένα νέο. θα αλλάξω σπίτι την άλλη εβδομάδα. Θα πάω να μείνω σε ένα καινούργιο διαμέρισμα. Δεν είναι πολύ μεγάλο. Έχει σαλόνι, μία μικρή κουζίνα, μπάνιο και τρία δωμάτια.
Το δικό μου δωμάτιο θα γίνει πολύ ωραίο. Θα βάλω το κρεβάτι μου και την ντουλάπα με όλα μου τα ρούχα και τα παπούτσια. Το γραφείο χωράει απέναντι από το κρεβάτι. Αγόρασα και καινούργια καρέκλα. θα βάλω την πολυθρόνα κοντά στο παράθυρο. Έτσι Θα κοιτώ τον ουρανό όλη την ώρα! Ο μπαμπάς θα κρεμάσει ένα ράφι για τα βιβλία μου. Θα μαζέψω όλα τα παιχνίδια μου σε ένα μεγάλο κουτί. Θα τα αφήσω σε μία γωνία για να παίζουμε. Η μαμά θα στρώσει ένα όμορφο χαλί. Είμαι πολύ χαρούμενη για το καινούργιο σπίτι. Πότε θα έρθεις; Θέλω πολύ να σου δείξω το δωμάτιό μου!

Πολλά φιλιά, Κατερίνα

Hey Nick,

What are you doing; I AM very well. I have a new one. I will change home the other week. I will go to stay in a new apartment. It's not too big. It has a living room, a kitchenette, a bathroom and three rooms.
My own room will become very nice. I will put my bed and wardrobe with all my clothes and shoes. The office fits across the bed. I bought and new chair. I will put the armchair near the window. So I will look at the sky all the time! Dad will hang a shelf for my books. I will pick up all my games in a large box. I'll leave them at a corner to play. Mom will lay a beautiful carpet. I am very happy about the new home. When will you come; I want to show you my room!

Many Kisses, Katerina

Ζούμε μαζί με άλλους ανθρώπους. Η οικογένεια, οι γείτονες, οι φίλοι, οι κάτοικοι της πόλης, όλοι είμαστε μια κοινωνία. Πολλές φορές οι γείτονες βοηθάνε ο ένας τον άλλον.
Βλέπουμε κάποιο γνωστό στο δρόμο και του λέμε καλημέρα.
Συχνά, πηγαίνουμε επίσκεψη σε κάποιο φίλο.
Δε βάζουμε δυνατά την τηλεόραση, γιατί ενοχλούμε τους γείτονες.
Βγάζουμε περίπατο το σκύλο με λουρί. Έτσι ο κόσμος δεν τρομάζει.
Πετάμε τα χαρτιά στο καλάθι και όχι στο πάτωμα.
Κάνουμε ποδήλατο στο δρόμο και όχι πάνω στα φυτά.

Γεννήθηκα στις Σέρρες το 1974. Εκεί ξεκίνησα το σχολείο. Πολύ γρήγορα φύγαμε με την οικογένειά μου από τις Σέρρες. Πήγαμε στην Ορεστιάδα και μείναμε 3 χρόνια. Μετά πήγα στη Δράμα. Στη Δράμα τελείωσα το σχολείο. Σπούδασα στη Θεσσαλονίκη αγγλική φιλολογία. Τώρα είμαι καθηγήτρια κι έχω πολλούς μαθητές. Τους μαθαίνω αγγλικά. Η δουλειά μου μου αρέσει πολύ, γιατί έχει σχέση με παιδιά. Τώρα τελευταία κάνω μερικά μαθήματα και σε ενήλικες. Μου αρέσει πολύ και θέλω να ανοίξω ένα φροντιστήριο για ξένες γλώσσες. Δεν ξέρω αν μπορέσω, αλλά θα προσπαθήσω πολύ, γιατί μου αρέσει. Επίσης, μου αρέσει πολύ και η ζωή σε άλλες χώρες. Το όνειρό μου είναι σε πέντε χρόνια να ζω και να δουλεύω σε κάποια χώρα της βόρειας Ευρώπης.

Φούσκωσε πολλά μπαλόνια και τα κρέμασε στα δέντρα. Η αδερφή του θα στρώσει το τραπέζι. Θα βάλει το πορτοκαλί τραπεζομάντηλο, ποτήρια, πιάτα, χαρτοπετσέτες και κουταλάκια. Το καλύτερο όμως από όλα θα είναι η τούρτα.
Η μητέρα είπε ότι θα φτιάξει μία τεράστια τούρτα. Θα τη στολίσει με τέσσερις κλόουν και πολλά πολλά κερασάκια. Θα βάλει σίγουρα και τα εννέα κεράκια.

Η καλή μάγισσα με τη δύναμή που έχει κάνει καλές πράξεις. Είναι νέα και όμορφη και όχι γριά και άσχημη σαν την κακή μάγισσα. Αγαπάει πολύ τα παιδιά και κάνει όλες τις ευχές τους πραγματικότητα. Πολλές φορές φροντίζει τους φτωχούς ανθρώπους και χαρίζει μαγικά δώρα. Με τα μαγικά της καταφέρνει να χαρίσει ένα όμορφο μωρό στο βασιλιά και στη βασίλισσα. Όταν γεννηθεί το μωρό, του δίνει χίλιες χρυσές ευχές. Όταν αρρωσταίνει κάποιος, φτιάχνει ένα σιρόπι που έχει γεύση τσίχλας και με αυτό τον κάνει αμέσως καλά. Προστατεύει τα σπίτια από τα κακά ξωτικά του δάσους. Βοηθά τους γονείς να βρουν τα χαμένα παιδιά τους.

Λοιπόν, αυτή είναι η πέμπτη φορά που αλλάζω σπίτι. Είμαι πολύ χαρούμενος.
Το πρώτο μου σπίτι ήταν κοντά στη θάλασσα. Είχε όμορφη θέα αλλά ήταν μακριά από το κέντρο.
Το δεύτερο σπίτι μου ήταν πιο κοντά στο κέντρο της πόλης. Είχε, όμως, πολύ θόρυβο. Ήταν κοντά στο σταθμό των τρένων.
Μετά πήγα σε ένα μεγάλο διαμέρισμα. Ήταν απέναντι από ένα πάρκο. Εκεί έκανα κάθε μέρα βόλτα το σκύλο μου.
Το σπίτι που θα μείνω τώρα, είναι τέλειο! Είναι στο κέντρο και δίπλα σε πάρκο. Έχω δικό μου κήπο και θέα προς το λιμάνι.

Τα καΐκια, οι βάρκες - ταξί, κουβαλούν τους τουρίστες στις παραλίες του νησιού. Τα καΐκια πηγαίνουν στις γνωστές (Αχλαδιές, Βρωμόλιμνος) ή παραλίες μακριά από δρόμους (Κάστρο, Λαλάρια, Ασέληνος), αλλά και στα νησιά χωρίς κατοίκους. Με καΐκι πηγαίνει κανείς στα κοντινά νησιά Σκόπελο και Αλόννησο (ξεκινούν από Σκιάθο 09:30 με 10:00 το πρωί και επιστρέφουν στις 17:00 το απόγευμα). Αν δεν σας κουράζει η θάλασσα, να ταξιδέψετε με καΐκι, γιατί είναι ωραία εμπειρία. Και αν είστε τυχεροί, ίσως να δείτε και δελφίνια!

Πριν 20 χρόνια φύγαμε από το Λύκειο. Σπουδάσαμε. Βρήκαμε δουλειά. Κάναμε οικογένεια. Δεν ξεχάσαμε, όμως, τους συμμαθητές μας. Θυμόμαστε τα χρόνια εκείνα με αγάπη και θέλουμε να τα ζήσουμε ξανά.
Θέλουμε να πάμε στο σχολείο μας, να επισκεφτούμε τις τάξεις μας, να δούμε τους παλιούς συμμαθητές μας.
Σας προσκαλούμε, λοιπόν, όλους στην αυλή του σχολείου μας, το Σάββατο 8 Σεπτεμβρίου στις 7 το απόγευμα. Μετά τη συνάντηση, θα πάμε για φαγητό στο εστιατόριο «Οι συμμαθητές». Είναι 20 μέτρα μακριά από το σχολείο.

Μια φορά κι ένα καιρό, το λιοντάρι, ο βασιλιάς των ζώων, αρρώστησε βαριά και κάλεσε όλα τα ζώα, για να του πουν τι φάρμακο να πάρει. Μαζί με τα άλλα ζώα πήγε και ο λύκος. Εκείνος του είπε ότι μόνο η αλεπού ξέρει το φάρμακο, αλλά αυτή δεν έτρεξε να τον βοηθήσει. Αμέσως, λοιπόν, το λιοντάρι διέταξε να πιάσουν την αλεπού και να της κόψουν τη γλώσσα.
Ένα πουλάκι, που άκουσετο λιοντάρι και το λύκο να μιλούν, πήγε στην αλεπού και της είπε τα νέα. Τότε εκείνη έκοψε από το δάσος μερικά βότανα και τα πήγε στο λιοντάρι. Του είπε ότι άργησε, γιατί έπρεπε να μαζέψει τα βότανα. Όταν το λιοντάρι τη ρώτησε αν αυτά θα του κάνουν καλό, η αλεπού του απάντησε να τα βράσει με τη γλώσσα ενός λύκου και να πιει το φάρμακο.
Έτσι και έγινε. Το λιοντάρι διέταξε να κόψουν τη γλώσσα του λύκου, την έβρασε με τα βότανα και ήπιε το φάρμακο. Η πονηρή αλεπού τιμώρησε το λύκο με αυτό τον τρόπο.

Once upon a time, the lion, the king of the animals, I was heavy and called all the animals to tell him what medicine to get. Together with the other animals, the wolf went. He told him that only the fox knows the medicine, but she did not ran to help him. Immediately, the lion commanded to catch the fox and cut her tongue.
A bird, who heard lion and the wolf talk, went to the fox and told her the news. Then she cut from the forest some herbs and went to the lion. He told him that he was slow, because he had to collect herbs. When the lion asked her if they will make him good, his fox replied to boil with the language of a wolf and drink the medicine.
So it happened. The lion ordered to cut the tongue of the wolf, it rushed her with herbs and drank the medicine. The wicked fox pounced the wolf in this way.

Κάθε Κυριακή πηγαίνω στο πάρκο με τους γονείς μου. Το πάρκο είναι μεγάλο. Έχει δέντρα και όμορφα λουλούδια. Έχει και πολλά ζώα. Τα ζώα είναι άγρια και ζουν ελεύθερα.
O ελέφαντας είναι το αγαπημένο μου ζώο. Είναι ψηλός, γκρίζος και έχει μεγάλα αυτιά. Περπατάει αργά. Παίζει με τα μικρά ελεφαντάκια, τρώει χόρτα και πίνει νερό με την προβοσκίδα του. Μερικές φορές φωνάζει δυνατά. Τότε οι μαϊμούδες τρομάζουν και πηδούν γρήγορα από το ένα δέντρο στο άλλο.
Περνάω πολύ ωραία στο πάρκο. Το ίδιο και ο αδερφός μου. Μιλάει για τα λιοντάρια όλη την ώρα! Ο Περικλής είναι το αγαπημένο του λιοντάρι. Είναι πέντε χρονών. Τα μάτια του έχουν παράξενο χρώμα. Είναι μπλε και πράσινα μαζί. Ο Περικλής έχει μία μεγάλη ουρά και δυνατά πόδια. Τρέχει πολύ γρήγορα. Πολλές φορές κοιμάται κάτω από τα δέντρα.

Every Sunday I go to the park with my parents. The park is big. It has trees and beautiful flowers. It also has many animals. Animals are wild and live freely.
The elephant is my favorite animal. It is tall, gray and has big ears. Walks slowly. He plays with small events, eating greens and drinks water with his proboscis. Sometimes it shouts loudly. Then the monkeys scare and jump quickly from one tree to another.

Ο Ηρακλής από τη Θήβα ήταν μεγάλος ήρωας της αρχαίας Ελλάδας. Πατέρας του ήταν ο Δίας και ήταν πολύ δυνατός. Ένα βράδυ η θεά Ήρα είπε σε δύο μεγάλα φίδια να πάνε στην κούνια του. Ο Ηρακλής, όμως, δεν τρόμαξε, αλλά έπιασε τα δύο φίδια από το λαιμό και τα έπνιξε. Ο Ηρακλής μεγάλωσε και έγινε πολύ γενναίος. Ήταν πρώτος σε όλα τα αθλήματα και δεν ένιωσε ποτέ φόβο. Η μητέρα του, όμως, φρόντισε ο γιος της να έχει και γνώσεις και γι’ αυτό βρήκε τους καλύτερους δασκάλους.

Έχω ένα μικρό σκυλάκι, την Τάμι. Είναι κοριτσάκι και είναι τριών μηνών. Τη βρήκα έξω από το σπίτι μας. Ήταν Τετάρτη και πήγαινα σχολείο. Κάποιος την άφησε σε μας. Πάντα ήθελα ένα σκυλάκι. Η μαμά φώναζε, αλλά εγώ την κράτησα.
Η Τάμι είναι άσπρη και μικρούλα. Τρώει πολύ. Τρεις φορές την ημέρα. Πίνει και πολύ γάλα.
Τη σκυλίτσα μου την είπα Τάμι, γιατί έτσι λένε τη φίλη μου. Τις αγαπάω και τις δύο πάρα πολύ! Κάθε μέρα έρχεται σπίτι μου η Τάμι, η φίλη μου, και παίζουμε με τη μικρούλα Τάμι. Είμαι πολύ χαρούμενη που έχω δύο πολύ καλές φίλες.

Πριν λίγες μέρες βρήκα ένα μικρό γατάκι. Το πήρα σπίτι μου. Είναι άσπρο. Έχει πολύ ωραία ουρά. Είναι όμορφο και μου κάνει παρέα. Χρειάζεται όμως προσοχή. Πρώτα πρώτα πρέπει να προσέχω το φαγητό του. Δε μπορεί να φάει όλα τα φαγητά. Επίσης, πρέπει να καθαρίζω πολύ συχνά. Αυτό είναι λίγο κουραστικό. Το πιο σημαντικό όμως είναι ότι περνάω πολύ καλά μαζί του. Έχω παρέα! Το βράδυ κοιμάται κάτω από το κρεβάτι μου. Έχει ένα μικρό καλαθάκι για κρεβάτι. Χθες, όμως, ανέβηκε στο κρεβάτι μου. Κοιμήθηκε στα πόδια μου!

Συμβουλές εκδρομής
Είστε έτοιμοι για την εκδρομή σας; Για να δούμε…
Είναι ο καιρός καλός; Βάλτε αθλητικά παπούτσια με λεπτές κάλτσες. Προτιμείστε τα ελαφρά και λεπτά ρούχα. Την άνοιξη και το καλοκαίρι μη φοράτε πολλά ρούχα γιατί θα ζεσταθείτε πολύ.
Το χειμώνα ντυθείτε διαφορετικά. Βάλτε πουλόβερ, ζακέτα και μπουφάν! Βρέχει; Τότε βάλτε μποτάκια με σόλες που δε γλιστρούν. Με το κρύο να φοράτε πάντα σκούφο και γάντια. Όλες τις εποχές μην ξεχνάτε γυαλιά και καπέλο για τον ήλιο. Τέλος, πάρτε ένα σακίδιο για την πλάτη. Είναι σημαντικό να έχετε ελεύθερα τα χέρια σας.

Σήμερα θα σας πω μία ιστορία για μία αλεπού.
Μια φορά κι έναν καιρό ήταν τρεις βοσκοί. Πήγαν για δουλειά και άφησαν το φαγητό τους στην τρύπα ενός δέντρου. Ήταν ψωμί, κρέας και τυρί, για να φάνε μετά τη δουλειά τους.
Μία αλεπού, όμως, περνάει από εκεί. Βλέπει το νόστιμο φαγητό! Μπαίνει, λοιπόν , μέσα στην τρύπα του δέντρου και… το τρώει όλο! Το φαγητό όμως είναι πολύ και η αλεπού γίνεται πολύ χοντρή! Έτσι δεν μπορεί πια να βγει από την τρύπα του δέντρου!
-Αχ, αχ τι έπαθα, φωνάζει και κλαίει. Πονάει η κοιλιά μου. Αχ, αχ, σε λίγο έρχονται οι βοσκοί!

Αγαπημένη μου γιαγιά,

Ξεκίνησε το σχολείο και χαίρομαι πάρα πολύ. Κάθε βράδυ ετοιμάζω τη τσάντα μου για την επόμενη μέρα. Βλέπω το πρόγραμμα και παίρνω αυτά που χρειάζομαι. Τη Δευτέρα έχω μαζί το χάρακα για τα μαθηματικά. Την Τρίτη κουβαλάω τα παπούτσια για τη γυμναστική. Την Τετάρτη και τη Πέμπτη έχουμε ζωγραφική και παίρνω τις μπογιές μου. Την Πέμπτη έχουμε και μαθηματικά. ΓΙ αυτό βάζω στη τσάντα μου το χάρακα. Την Παρασκευή έχουμε πάλι γυμναστική και πρέπει να φοράω τα ωραία μου παπούτσια.
Γιαγιά πότε θα έρθεις στο σπίτι να μας δεις;

Πολλά φιλιά, Νίκος

My favorite grandmother,

Started school and I am very happy. Each night I get ready my bag for the next day. I see the program and get what I need. Monday I have the ruler for mathematics together. Tuesday I carry the shoes for the gym. On Wednesday and Thursday we have painting and I get my paintings. On Thursday we have mathematics. That's why I put in my bag the ruler.

Many kisses, Nikos

Τα ταξίδια μου αρέσουν πολύ. Θέλω να ταξιδέψω σ’ όλον τον κόσμο. Πρώτα θέλω να επισκεφτώ τη Ρώμη. Αυτή η πόλη έχει τόσα πράγματα που θέλω να δω. Το Κολοσσαίο είναι το πιο γνωστό μνημείο. Το έχτισαν πριν χιλιάδες χρόνια. Πάρα πολλοί τουρίστες πηγαίνουν κάθε μέρα. Ξέρω από τώρα ότι θα περιμένω αρκετή ώρα για να μπω μέσα. Σίγουρα θα δω και τη Βασιλική του Αγίου Πέτρου. Είναι μία καταπληκτική εκκλησία που έχει πολλά έργα τέχνης. Η Ρώμη, όμως, έχει και πάρα πολλές ωραίες πλατείες. Θέλω να πάω λοιπόν στην Πιάτσα Ναβόνε. Θα βγάλω πολλές φωτογραφίες εκεί. Όταν επιστρέψω στο σπίτι, θα τις δείξω στους φίλους μου!

My travel likes a lot. I want to travel all over the world. First I want to visit Rome. This city has so many things I want to see. The Colosseum is the most famous monument. They built it thousands of years ago. Too many tourists go every day. I know from now that I will wait a long time to get in. I will definitely see the Basilica of St. Peter. It is an amazing church that has many works of art. Rome, however, has too many nice squares. I want to go to the Piazza Navnon. I'll take a lot of pictures there. When I get back home, I will show them to my friends!

Μελίνα: Καλημέρα Έφη!
Έφη: Γεια σου, Μελίνα. Τι κάνεις;
Μελίνα: Είμαι πολύ καλά. Έχω νέα! Θα μάθω κιθάρα. Θα πηγαίνω στο ωδείο.
Έφη: Και εμένα μου αρέσει η μουσική. Θέλω να μάθω βιολί. Εσύ έχεις κιθάρα;
Μελίνα: Όχι, αύριο θα αγοράσω.
Έφη: Πόσες φορές την εβδομάδα θα πηγαίνεις;
Μελίνα: Κάθε Παρασκευή. Το μάθημα αρχίζει στις πέντε και τελειώνει στις έξι το βράδυ. Μετά θα πηγαίνω σινεμά με τους γονείς μου.
Έφη: Εγώ τις Παρασκευές καθαρίζω το δωμάτιό μου και μετά παίζω μπάσκετ με το μικρό μου αδερφό. Μόνο αυτή την Παρασκευή θα διαβάσω τα μαθήματά μου, γιατί το Σάββατο είναι η γιορτή μου. Θέλεις να έρθεις; Θα κάνω πάρτι!
Μελίνα: Σ’ ευχαριστώ πολύ Έφη. Η μητέρα μου είπε ότι το Σάββατο θα πάμε στο χωριό. Θέλω πολύ να δω τη γιαγιά μου.
Έφη: Είναι μακριά το χωριό;
Μελίνα: Όχι πολύ μακριά. Το χωριό μου είναι πολύ ωραίο. Έχει πολλά δέντρα και καθόλου αυτοκίνητα. Το σπίτι της γιαγιάς μου είναι μικρό και έχει ένα όμορφο κήπο. Περνάω πολύ καλά όταν πηγαίνω στο χωριό μου.

Η είδηση δεν συγκίνησε κανέναν. Οι εφημερίδες, τα κόμματα και οι κάθε είδους προοδευτικοί είναι απασχολημένοι με πολιτικές αναλύσεις και έτσι δεν βρήκαν την ευκαιρία ούτε να αναλύσουν ούτε να καταγγείλουν το γεγονός. Κανένας δεν φώναξε για σκάνδαλο, γιατί φαίνεται ότι όλοι στην εποχή της παγκοσμιοποίησης δεν έχουν τίποτε να πουν για την παγκοσμιοποίηση της εκμετάλλευσης των παιδιών. Στην εποχή μας σκάνδαλο είναι ότι πέφτει το χρηματιστήριο και όχι ότι κάθε λεπτό πεθαίνουν 25 παιδιά από ασιτία. Απασχολεί ελάχιστους ότι 250 εκατομμύρια αγοράκια και κοριτσάκια σε όλον τον κόσμο ηλικίας 5 – 14 χρόνων δουλεύουν 14 – 16 ώρες την ημέρα δένοντας κόμπους σε χαλιά, στρίβοντας φύλλα καπνού, κόβοντας σπίρτα, ότι παιδάκια παραμορφώνουν τα χέρια τους ράβοντας μπάλες, κόβοντας διαμάντια, παραμορφώνουν τα πόδια τους δουλεύοντας σε εργοστάσια (…), ότι παιδάκια ξεφορτώνουν τούβλα στο Νεπάλ για 70 σεντς σε κάθε 100 διαδρομές μεταξύ του φορτηγού και του γιαπιού.
Ο ιδιοκτήτης της συγκεκριμένης πολυεθνικής δεν είναι ούτε χειρότερος ούτε καλύτερος από τους υπόλοιπους άρχοντες των πολυεθνικών. Ακολουθεί τους νόμους της ελεύθερης αγοράς, όπως κάνουν όλοι, μεταφέροντας την παραγωγή του εκεί όπου το κόστος εργασίας είναι χαμηλότερο – εκεί όπου τα δικαιώματα εργασίας είναι ελάχιστα ως και ανύπαρκτα. Και αν σε αυτές τις χώρες δουλεύουν μωρά, δε φταίει μόνο η πολιτισμένη Δύση. Φταίνε και οι νόμοι των υπανάπτυκτων κρατών, φταίνε και οι γονείς τους που βάζουν τα παιδιά τους να δουλεύουν.
Τελικά πόσο όμορφος είναι ο κόσμος της ελεύθερης αγοράς, ο κόσμος της παγκοσμιοποίησης; Υπάρχουν στον πλανήτη ένα δισεκατομμύριο φτωχά παιδιά και οι στατιστικές της Unicef λένε ότι ένα στα δύο εργάζεται στην κυριολεξία για ένα πιάτο φαί στις βιομηχανίες που παράγουν προϊόντα made in … που πωλούνται στις αγορές της Δύσης. Οι στατιστικές, επίσης, λένε ότι το ένα στα δύο παιδιά των φτωχών του πλανήτη δεν είναι παραγωγικό. Οι αγορές δεν το χρειάζονται. Και όποιος δεν παράγει, ως γνωστόν, δε χρειάζεται. Γι’ αυτό καλύτερα να πεθαίνουν προτού μεγαλώσουν και γίνουν επικίνδυνα.
Για όσους σηκώνουν αδιάφοροι τους ώμους νομίζοντας ότι αυτά συμβαίνουν μακριά τους, έχω δυσάρεστα νέα. Σύμφωνα με το υπουργείο Εργασίας των ΗΠΑ, πέντε εκατομμύρια παιδιά – κυρίως μεταναστών από τη Λατινική Αμερική – εργάζονται οικοδομώντας το αμερικανικό θαύμα. Στη Βρετανία τέσσερα στα δέκα παιδιά εργάζονται με μηδαμινά μεροκάματα.
Τα παιδιά του κόσμου ουρλιάζουν στέλνοντας μηνύματα αγωνίας, αλλά αυτά δεν φθάνουν στα αυτιά των προοδευτικών. Οι τελευταίοι έχουν άλλα σοβαρότερα προβλήματα να επιλύσουν από εκείνα της φτώχειας, της εκμετάλλευσης, της ανισότητας, της περιθωριοποίησης, της αδικίας. Αγωνιούν να πείσουν ότι είναι αρκετά ρεαλιστές για να επιβάλουν την ανταγωνιστικότητα, την κινητικότητα των εργαζομένων, την ανεργία. Δεν είναι δύσκολο για αυτούς να θυσιάσουν μερικές εκατοντάδες χιλιάδες παιδιά στο βωμό της παγκοσμιοποίησης.

At least 250 million baby boys and girls around the world 5 - 14 years old They work 14 - 16 hours a day binding knots on carpets, twisting tobacco leaves, cutting matches, that kids deform their hands sewing balls, cutting diamonds, deforming their legs working in factories (...) that children get rid of bricks in Nepal for 70 cents on every 100 routes between the truck and the Grace.

Στο σπίτι του Αϊνστάιν είχε στρωθεί το τραπέζι για το πρωινό και η (δεύτερη) σύζυγός του τού φώναζε να κατέβει από το πάνω όροφο όπου συνέχιζε να κοιμάται. Ο Αϊνστάιν κατέβηκε φορώντας βαριεστημένα επάνω του τη ρόμπα της εποχής, αλλά μετά δυσκολίας καθόταν να φάει το πρωινό του. Η σύζυγός του νόμισε ότι είχε πάθει κάτι και τον ρώτησε αν ήταν καλά. «Αγάπη μου», της απάντησε, «έχω μια θαυμάσια ιδέα!». Ήπιε το ζεστό καφέ του και πήγε και κάθισε στο πιάνο αρχίζοντας να παίζει ένα κομμάτι. Ξαφνικά σταματά, παίρνει ένα φύλλο χαρτί και γράφει κάποιες σημειώσεις. Κάνει μια παύση και γυρίζει προς τη σύζυγό του που συνεχίζει να τον κοιτά με έκπληξη: «Έχω μια θαυμάσια ιδέα, μια εξαίσια ιδέα!» της ξαναλέει. Αυτή, σαστισμένη, τον ρωτά με ένα μείγμα αγανάκτησης και αγωνίας: «Για όνομα του Θεού, Άλμπερτ, πες μου τι είναι, μη με κρατάς σε αγωνία!». «Είναι δύσκολο να σου την εξηγήσω, πρέπει να την επεξεργαστώ κι άλλο», της απάντησε ο Αϊνστάιν και στράφηκε πάλι προς το πιάνο παίζοντας μουσική και γράφοντας σημειώσεις για μισή ώρα, περίπου. Κατόπιν, ανέβηκε στο πάνω πάτωμα λέγοντάς της ότι δεν ήθελε να τον ενοχλήσει κανένας και έμεινε εκεί για δύο βδομάδες.
Η γυναίκα του τού πήγαινε φαγητό καθημερινά και τον βράδυ τον έβλεπε να περπατά για λίγη ώρα για να ασκηθεί και μετά να ξαναεπιστρέψει στην εργασία του. Τελικά, μετά από δύο βδομάδες, ο Αϊνστάιν κατέβηκε πολύ χλωμός από το πάνω πάτωμα, πλησίασε το τραπέζι και της είπε: «Αυτό είναι!» αφήνοντας βαριεστημένα μπροστά της δύο φύλλα χαρτιού. Επρόκειτο για τη γενική θεωρία της σχετικότητας, μιας θεωρίας που έμελε να αλλάξει τον ρου της ιστορίας και της ζωής μας για πάντα.
Έπειτα από την τελική διατύπωση και την πρώτη πειραματική απόδειξη και επαλήθευση της θεωρίας, αποκτήσαμε μια νέα θέαση για το σύμπαν και τη θέση μας σ’αυτό. Το οικοδόμημα του Νεύτωνα είχε δείξει τα όρια του για τις υψηλές ταχύτητες μέσα από τη διατύπωση της ειδικής θεωρίας της σχετικότητας (γιατί όντως υπάρχουν «δύο» θεωρίες της σχετικότητας, η γενική και η ειδική), ενώ ο Αϊνστάιν μετά από τη διατύπωση της γενικής θεωρίας δέχτηκε τα κύματα του φθόνου του περίγυρού του και ενός ακραίου μίσους που υπονόμευσε κατά πολύ την πρώτη υποδοχή της ιστορικής αυτής ανακάλυψης.
Η άλλη ακραία πλευρά της στάσης έναντι του μεγαλοφυούς επιστήμονα είναι η γνωστή, άκριτη αναγόρευσή του σε μύθο. Αυτή η δεύτερη πλευρά, υποστηριζόμενη σε μεγάλο βαθμό από τα μέσα μαζικής ενημέρωσης που ήδη είχαν αρχίσει τις διαδικασίες κατασκευής ειδώλων, οδήγησε σε έναν άκρατο μιμητισμό εκ μέρους των φυσικών, που άρχισαν, άλλοι να κυκλοφορούν με επιμελώς ατημέλητα μαλλιά ή ρούχα, άλλοι να αναζητούν απεγνωσμένα την τροφή που έτρωγε ή τη μουσική που έπαιζε κατά τις κρίσιμες βδομάδες συγγραφής του άρθρου και άλλοι να εγκαταλείπουν ξαφνικά την κοπέλα τους δηλώνοντας πως βρήκαν μια θαυμάσια ιδέα, να εξαφανίζονται και γυρίζοντας άπρακτοι μετά από δυο βδομάδες να μη βρίσκουν πια ούτε την ίδια την κοπέλα.
Έτσι το περιβάλλον που συστάθηκε γύρω από το όνομα του επιστήμονα απομάκρυνε δυστυχώς πολλούς ανθρώπους από μια ισορροπημένη σύλληψη του πώς και γιατί κατάφερε να διατυπώσει τις σωστές εξισώσεις της γενικής θεωρίας της σχετικότητας − που αποδείχθηκε, μέχρι τη στιγμή που γράφονται αυτές οι γραμμές, ως η ακριβέστερη θεωρία που διαθέτουμε. Όλα τα παραδεκτά σήμερα δεδομένα εξέλιξης του σύμπαντος βασίζονται στις εξισώσεις του Αϊνστάιν, καθώς κάθε επίλυση των εξισώσεών του μας δίνει όλη την ιστορία κάποιου σύμπαντος.
Αυτά τα κοσμολογικά μοντέλα υποδεικνύουν ότι το σύμπαν βρίσκεται ακόμα σε φάση επέκτασης των ορίων του. Διάφορες αστρονομικές παρατηρήσεις του ρυθμού επέκτασης του σύμπαντος επιτρέπουν σήμερα να υπολογίσει κανείς το ποσό της συνολικής ύλης στο σύμπαν. Περίπου το 90% της ύλης προκύπτει ότι είναι η λεγόμενη «σκοτεινή ύλη» που έχει μεν μάζα (δηλαδή βαρυτική επίδραση) αλλά που δεν επιδρά ηλεκτρομαγνητικά (και συνεπώς δεν μπορεί να παρατηρηθεί ευθέως). Μια άλλη σημαντική συνέπεια της γενικής θεωρία της σχετικότητας αφορά την πρόβλεψη της ύπαρξης ορίων στο χωροχρόνο που ονομάζονται χωροχρονικές ανωμαλίες.
Σε γενικές γραμμές, η γενική θεωρία έχει αναδειχθεί ως το πιο επιτυχημένο μοντέλο για το σύμπαν μας! Μέχρι τώρα, όλες οι παρατηρήσεις και τα πειράματα επιβεβαιώνουν τη γενική θεωρία. Βέβαια, υπάρχουν και πολλά ανοιχτά ζητήματα που καταδεικνύουν τη μη πληρότητά της αλλά στο σύνολό της η θεωρία έχει αποδειχθεί ως ένα από τα σημαντικότερα επιτεύγματα του ανθρώπινου νου.
Βέβαια, και ο ίδιος ο επιστήμονας, όπως μπορούμε να συνάγουμε και από τις συνθήκες δημιουργίας της θεωρίας, παρότι υπήρξε ένας από τους σπουδαιότερους επιστήμονες, ήταν άνθρωπος χωρίς έπαρση, με χιούμορ και αγάπη για τους

At Einstein's home he had been laid the table for breakfast and his (second) husband shouted to come down from the upper floor where he was sleeping. Einstein descended wearing bored on the robe of the time, but after difficulty sitting to eat the Breakfast. His wife thought he had suffered something and asked him if he was good.

She is re-doing so, he was dismantled, asking him with a mixture of indignation and anxiety: "For the name of God, Albert, tell me what it is, do not keep me anguish!"

At Einstein's house the breakfast table had been set and his (second) wife called him down from the top floor where he continued to sleep.Einstein came down wearing bored on him the robe of the time, but then he was hardly able to eat his breakfast.His wife thought something had happened and asked him if he was okay."My love" she replied, "I have a wonderful idea!"He drank his hot coffee and went and sat on the piano starting to play a piece.Suddenly it stops, takes a sheet of paper and writes some notes.He pauses and goes back to his wife who continues to look at him with a surprise: "I have a wonderful idea, an excellent idea!"She, blasphemed, asks him with a mixture of indignation and anxiety: "For God's sake, Albert, tell me what it is, don't hold me in agony!""It's hard to explain to you, I have to process it further," Einstein answered and turned back towards the piano playing music and writing notes for about half an hour.Then she went up on the top floor saying she didn’t want anyone to bother him and stayed there for two weeks.His wife went daily and at night watched him walk for a while to practice and then return to work.Finally, after two weeks, Einstein came down very pale from the top floor, approached the table and said, "That's it!" leaving him bored in front of two paper sheets.It was about the general theory of relativity, a theory that was intended to change the course of our history and life forever.After the final wording and first experimental proof and verification of the theory, we gained a new view of the universe and our place in it.The structure of Newton had shown its limits for high speeds through the formulation of the specific theory of relativity (because there are "two" theories of relativity, general and special), while Einstein, after the wording of the general theory, accepted the waves of the envy of his envy and an extreme hatred that largely undermined the first reception of this historical discovery.The other extreme side of attitude toward the genius scientist is his well - known, infinite myth.This second side, largely supported by the media that had already begun the process of making idols, led to an insurmountable imitation on the part of natural persons who began, others having diligent hair or clothes, others desperately seeking the food that he ate or the music he played during the critical weeks of writing the article and others suddenly leaving their girlfriend stating that they found a wonderful idea, disappearing and spinning unrealistic after two weeks not finding the girl anymore.So the environment that was set up around the scientist's name has unfortunately removed many people from a balanced conception of how and why he managed to formulate the correct equations of the general theory of relativity.All the acceptable data on the evolution of the universe today is based on Einstein's equations, as any resolution of his equations gives us the whole history of a universe.These cosmic models suggest that the universe is still in a phase of expansion of its boundaries.A number of astronomical observations on the rate of expansion of the universe today allow the amount of total material in the universe to be calculated.Approximately 90% of the matter shows that it is the so-called 'darky matter' which has a mass (i.e. gravitational effect) but which does not affect electromagnetics (and therefore cannot be observed directly).Another important consequence of the general theory of relativity is the prediction of the existence of boundaries in spacetime called spatial-time anomalies.In general, the general theory has emerged as the most successful model for our universe! Until now, all the observations and experiments confirm the general theory.Of course, there are many open issues that demonstrate its incompleteness but as a whole theory has been proved to be one of the most important achievements of the human mind.Of course, the scientist himself, as we can gather from the conditions of creation of the theory, even though there was one of the greatest scientists, was a man without pretension, with humor and love for them.

Ενώ οι σεισμοί και οι τυφώνες μοιάζουν συχνά να είναι οι πιο απειλητικοί τύποι φυσικών καταστροφών, τα ηφαίστεια μπορούν να έχουν πιο εκτεταμένα αποτελέσματα από τους δύο προηγούμενους, καθώς συνδέονται άμεσα με τη σεισμική δραστηριότητα. Στα περισσότερα μέρη του κόσμου, πάντως, όπου γίνονται σεισμοί, υπάρχουν και ενεργά ηφαίστεια.
Υπάρχουν, λοιπόν, 1.500 εν δυνάμει ενεργά ηφαίστεια σε όλο τον κόσμο, ενώ περίπου 550 ηφαίστεια έχουν εκραγεί στην επιφάνεια της Γης κατά τη διάρκεια της καταγεγραμμένης ιστορίας.
Έξοχο παράδειγμα της εκτεταμένης καταστροφής που μπορεί να προκαλέσει ένα ηφαίστειο αποτελεί η έκρηξη του ηφαιστείου των Φιλιππίνων Πινατούμπο, το 1991, που έδειξε ότι ένα ηφαίστειο μπορεί να δημιουργήσει ένα τεράστιο νέφος θειικού οξέος, το οποίο μπορεί να περικυκλώνει ολόκληρο τον πλανήτη. Εμείς, βέβαια, ως θεατές βλέπουμε εντυπωσιακές εικόνες έκχυσης ηφαιστειακής λάβας από τις οθόνες μας, αλλά οι κάτοικοι των ηφαιστιογενών περιοχών συχνά καλούνται, επειγόντως, να τις εκκενώσουν.
Τα πανέμορφα φυσικά τοπία που βρίσκονται συνήθως στις περιοχές αυτές λειτουργούν ως πόλος έλξης ενώ η έκρηξη διαμορφώνει ένα εύφορο και πλούσιο γεωλογικό περιβάλλον. Μάλιστα, πολλές από αυτές τις περιοχές έχουν διαμορφωθεί λόγω της έκρηξης και χωρίς την τελευταία δεν θα υπήρχαν καν στον παγκόσμιο χάρτη.
Ένα τέτοιο παράδειγμα απαράμιλλης φυσικής ομορφιάς και ηφαιστειακής δημιουργίας συνιστά η Ισλανδία, η οποία βρίσκεται ακριβώς πάνω από τις τεκτονικές πλάκες της Βόρειας Αμερικής και της Ευρασίας και οφείλει την ύπαρξή της αποκλειστικά σε αναρίθμητες εκρήξεις. Η Ισλανδία θαμπώνει τον επισκέπτη με το υπέροχο φυσικό της τοπίο, καθώς και τις εντυπωσιακές ερήμους λάβας δίπλα από σειρές ενεργών ηφαιστείων.

While earthquakes and hurricanes often look like to be the most threatening types of natural disasters, volcanoes can have more extensive results than the previous two, as they are directly linked to seismic activity. In most parts of the world, however, where earthquakes are made, there are also active volcanoes.
There are, therefore, 1,500 potentially active volcanoes around the world, while about 550 volcanoes have exploded on the land surface during recorded history.
Superior example of the extended destruction that can cause a volcano is the explosion of the Philippine Tableball volcano, in 1991, which showed that a volcano can create a huge sulfuric acid cloud, which can encircle the entire planet. We, of course, as spectators see impressive imagination images of volcanic lava from our screens, but the residents of volcanic regions are often called, urgently, to evacuate them.
Beautiful natural landscapes usually found in these areas act as a pole of attraction while the explosion forms a fertile and rich geological environment. Indeed, many of these areas have been shaped due to the explosion and without the latter there would not even be on the world map.
Such an example of unparalleled natural beauty and volcanic creation constitutes Iceland, which is located just above the masonry plates of North America and Eurasia and owes its existence exclusively to innumerable explosions. Iceland dazzles the visitor with its wonderful natural landscape, as well as impressive lava deserts next to lines of active volcanoes.

-Η έμπνευση σε συναντά ακατάσχετες ώρες ή βάζεις συγκεκριμένο ωράριο όταν γράφεις;
«Εξαρτάται από τί έχω να κάνω. Τώρα που δούλευα το Fame, δεν ήταν απαραίτητο να έχω έμπνευση, γιατί πατούσα σε ένα ήδη υπάρχον καλό κείμενο, οπότε το έκανα ουσιαστικά σε ώρες γραφείου, έλεγα "τώρα δουλεύω". Αλλά γενικότερα οι δικές μου ώρες γραφείου, όταν δηλαδή θέλω να φτιάξω κάτι, είναι ώρες που αφήνω κενές και περιφέρομαι στους δρόμους χωρίς πρόγραμμα. Γυρνάω σε παράξενους δρόμους ακούγοντας μουσική, ό,τι μουσική μπορείς να φανταστείς. Συνήθως διαλέγω πιο αστικά, λιγότερο ειδυλλιακά τοπία. Μπορεί να περπατήσω την Πέτρου Ράλλη ή την Πειραιώς κατά μήκος. Με λυτρώνει και με τροφοδοτεί αυτή η διαδικασία. Μου δίνει την πολυτέλεια να είμαι αφηρημένος, χαμένος. Να περπατώ σε μια ευθεία χωρίς να εστιάζω κάπου συγκεκριμένα. Οι φίλοι μου απορούν μαζί μου που διανύω τόσο μεγάλες αποστάσεις, τρώω πολύ δούλεμα. Έχω πάντα ένα μπλοκάκι και σημειώνω συνεχώς. Σκέψεις περισσότερο, δεν γράφω τόσο στίχους στο σημειωματάριο, αλλά και στο κινητό και σε μία χαρτοπετσέτα, παντού. Μόνο με σπρέι στον τοίχο δεν έχω γράψει ακόμη!».
-Το έντεχνο πέρασε και περνάει ακόμη μία σοβαρή «εντεχνίτιδα» σχετικά με δήθεν ψαγμένους, ασυνάρτητους στίχους. Εσύ έχεις θεωρηθεί από πολλούς η εξαίρεση…
«Τα δικά μου τραγούδια δεν τα ονομάζω έντεχνα. Γράφω τρα-γου-δια. Τραγουδένια, τραγουδάκια, να τραγουδιούνται, μπορείς να τα πεις με όσα υποκοριστικά θέλεις, αυτό που με ενδιαφέρει είναι να γίνονται μέρος της καθημερινότητας όποιου ανθρώπου είναι σε επαφή με τη συγκίνησή του. Δεν με ενδιαφέρει να έχει κώδικες εντέχνου, δεν με ενδιαφέρει καν να έχει κουπλέ-ρεφρέν-κουπλέ-ρεφρέν. Με ενδιαφέρει να είναι μικροί μονόλογοι που ένας άνθρωπος θα τους πετύχει στο ραδιόφωνό του ή θα τους βρει στο You Tube και θα πει "πες τα ρε, ναι αυτό είναι!". Δεν θέλει φτιασίδια το τραγούδι. Σίγουρα έχουν γραφτεί εξαιρετικά ποιητικά τραγούδια, αλλά είναι ένα εντελώς διαφορετικό πράγμα από αυτό που κάνω εγώ».
-Τι τραγούδια σου αρέσει να ακούς;
«Μου αρέσουν πάρα πολύ τα συγκεκριμένα τραγούδια, δηλαδή τα τραγούδια που μπορεί να σου μιλήσουν για ένα φλιτζανάκι κι ακόμη κι αν δεν έχεις τέτοιο φλιτζανάκι, να μοιράζεσαι το ξένο φλιτζανάκι, συγκινούμαι πολύ με όποιον το κάνει αυτό. Γι' αυτό λάτρεψα τόσο τους στίχους της Μαριανίνας Κριεζή για παράδειγμα. Η Μαριανίνα Κριεζή σου μίλαγε για έναν Παναγιώτη, εσύ μπορεί να μην ήξερες κανέναν Παναγιώτη, και για τη Σερενάτα τη γάτα της κι έλεγες "οκ, εγώ δεν έχω γάτα που τη λένε Σερενάτα, αλλά την απώλεια έτσι την έχω βιώσει". Αυτό θεωρώ εγώ τραγούδι».
-Πότε γράφεις καλύτερα, όταν είσαι χάλια, ή όταν είσαι καλά;
«Ποτέ δεν είμαι εντελώς καλά, οπότε όταν είμαι έτσι κι έτσι, προς χάλια! Είναι πολύ συγκεκριμένες στιγμές. Είναι μία μεταβατική φάση, γίνομαι άλλος άνθρωπος για κάποιο διάστημα. Βλέπω αλλιώς τον κόσμο, ζω λίγο έξω απ’ αυτόν, δεν ξέρω πότε ακριβώς έρχεται αυτό, αλλά έρχεται και με βρίσκει».
-Ποια είναι η ιστορία που κρύβεται πίσω από το «Εν λευκώ», το πιο επιτυχημένο τραγούδι που έχεις γράψει ως σήμερα και που κλείνει πάντα τις ζωντανές εμφανίσεις της Νατάσας Μποφίλιου;
«Είναι από τις πιο μαγικές στιγμές της συνεργασίας μας. Κατ' αρχήν είναι ένα τραγούδι που είχε μείνει για πολύ καιρό στο συρτάρι. Όλοι έλεγαν "ε, αυτό το τραγούδι δεν πρόκειται να πιάσει ποτέ". Όμως γι' αυτό ακριβώς δεν υπάρχουν συνταγές: έχει δέκα στροφές, δεν έχει ρεφρέν, λέει πράγματα που είναι παράξενα, μεταφυσικά και πολύ προσωπικά. Για μένα όλα αυτά που αναφέρονται είναι πολύ συγκεκριμένες αναφορές σε πολύ συγκεκριμένα πρόσωπα, δηλαδή εμένα με εξέθετε απόλυτα αυτό το τραγούδι. Βρήκε το δρόμο του λοιπόν με τη μουσική του Θέμη Καραμουρατίδη, ο οποίος ενώ το είχε στα χέρια του για πολύ καιρό, δεν καταπιανόταν μαζί του, του φαινόταν κι εκείνου παράξενο. Όταν όμως χρειάστηκε κι αυτός να βγάλει μια δική του κραυγή, πιάστηκε κι αυτός από το τραγούδι κι έτσι συναντηθήκαμε στο συναίσθημα και φυσικά μετά ήρθε και η Νατάσα που το απογείωσε με την ερμηνεία της κι έκανε την κραυγή κυριολεκτική, κι ενώ αρχικά μας τρόμαξε στην ηχογράφηση, τελικά δεν την κόψαμε. Δεν την είχαμε συζητήσει, της βγήκε εκείνη τη στιγμή στο στούντιο και την κρατήσαμε».
-Δεν φοβήθηκες να εκτεθείς τόσο πολύ μέσα από τους στίχους σου;
«Καθόλου! Ποτέ δεν το φοβάμαι αυτό, δεν γίνεται αλλιώς. Για μένα ήταν εγχείριση ανοιχτής καρδιάς αυτό το τραγούδι, έφυγε πολύ βάρος από πάνω μου, ήταν μια βόλτα στην Πέτρου Ράλλη, 3 η ώρα τη νύχτα, να φανταστείς ακόμη και αδέσποτα σκυλιά με είχαν πάρει από πίσω, αλλά δεν τα άκουγα γιατί φορούσα ακουστικά, το 2002, κάπου τότε πρέπει να γράφτηκε. Με πολλή στενοχώρια, ήταν μία περίοδος από εκείνες που νιώθεις ότι τίποτα δεν πηγαίνει καλά στη ζωή σου κι όλα σε διαψεύδουν με τον πιο κυνικό τρόπο. Μου ήρθε, λοιπόν, αυτή η ιδέα με στιχάκια-στιχάκια στη σειρά, χωρίς την προοπτική του τραγουδιού κι όταν λοιπόν το έβγαλα από μέσα μου, χωρίς καν να το καταγράψω το θυμόμουνα κι όταν γύρισα σπίτι κάθισα και το έγραψα. Την επόμενη μέρα ήμουν άλλος άνθρωπος. Πολύ πιο ήρεμος, πολύ πιο ήσυχος, έτσι λειτουργούν αυτά».
-Γράφεις πολύ συχνά για τη δυσκολία να έρθουμε κοντά. Γιατί είναι τόσο δύσκολες οι σχέσεις σήμερα;
«Επειδή εμείς οι ίδιοι έχουμε γίνει πάρα πολύ δύσκολοι και θέλουμε να προσδιορίσουμε τους εαυτούς μας μέσα από τις σχέσεις μας. Όταν το λύσουμε αυτό, οι σχέσεις θα είναι υπέροχες! Όμορφες, ήσυχες σχέσεις που μπορεί να μην σου δίνουν τον ουρανό με τ' άστρα, αλλά μία πολύ ωραία καθημερινότητα. ‘Όταν, όμως, αρχίζεις και ψάχνεις τον εαυτό σου μέσα στον άλλο άνθρωπο και βλέπεις τα κουσούρια σου μεγεθυμένα απέναντι σου, εκεί τελείωσε, το ‘χεις χάσει το παιχνίδι».
-Επίσης γράφεις συχνά και για απαγορευμένους έρωτες. Θεωρείς ότι ο έρωτας μπορεί να ανθίσει και σε κανονικές συνθήκες, ή πάντα θα έχουμε ανάγκη το δράμα και θα νιώθουμε καταραμένοι ποιητές;
«Εννοείται ότι μας αρέσει πολύ το δράμα, εξηγεί πολλά άλυτα θέματα που έχουμε με τον εαυτό μας. Διότι όταν ένας άνθρωπος ξυπνάει το πρωί και πάει σε μια δουλειά που δεν θέλει, πληρώνει έναν λογαριασμό που δεν θέλει, μετακινείται με ένα μέσο που δεν θέλει σε μια πόλη που δεν θέλει, ε είναι ωραίο να ξέρει ότι έχει και μια τραγωδία από πίσω του. Η οποία τραγωδία, βέβαια, δεν είναι από αυτές που σε οδηγούν στην καταστροφή, αλλά ανά πάσα στιγμή μπορείς να βγεις από αυτήν με δυο-τρία ποτήρια ουίσκι κι ένα ωραίο τραγούδι στο ραδιόφωνο. Μας αρέσει, μας κάνει να νιώθουμε ζωντανοί όλο αυτό το πράγμα. Και γινόμαστε και λίγο κινηματογραφικοί ήρωες, μυθιστορηματικοί, μας αρέσει το παραμύθι, το τραβάει ο οργανισμός μας. Και, βέβαια, γεννηθήκαμε για το δράμα, αυτό είναι σίγουρο».

-The inspiration can encounter knocking hours or putting a specific time when you are writing?
"It depends on what I have. I worked the FAME, it was not necessary to have an inspiration, because I fucked in an already existing good text, so I did it virtually in office hours, I said" now I'm working ".All Generally My Hours Office, when I want to make something, it's hours I leave empty and I'm on the streets without a program. In strange streets listening to music, what music you can imagine. I choose more urban, less idyllic landscapes. I can walk the Peter Rallis or Piraeus along. In redeeming and feeds me this process.Ma gives the luxury to be an abstract, loser. I walk in a straight without focusing somewhere. Very tame. I always have a block and I constantly note. I do not write both lyrics in the notebook, but also on the mobile and on a napkin, everywhere.Mone with spray on the wall I have not written I still! ".
- Entehno passed and even passes a serious "enteritis" on supposedly faced, incoherent verses. You have been considered by many the exception ... "My own songs I do not call it art. They are sung, you can tell them with what you want, what interests me is to become part of everyday life is in contact with his thrill.It is not interested in having figured codes, I do not even interest me to have a prince-chip -Ferely. You are interested in being small monologues that a man will succeed in his radio or find them in the You Tube and say "Tell the PEs, yes that's!". Does not want the song. Sunglasses have been written extremely poetic Songs, but it is a completely different thing than what I do. "
-What songs do you like to hear? "I like the specific songs, that is, the songs that can talk to you about a cup and even if you do not have such a cup, to share foreign cup, I'm very moving with anyone who does this . That's what I loved both the lyrics of Marianina Klazis for example. Marianina Kryzis you talked to you for a Panagiotis, you may not know anyone Panagiotis, and for her cat and checked "Ok, I do not have a cat that says Serenae, but the loss so I have experienced her. "That's what I think I song. "
-Who do you write better when you're crap, or when you're fine?
"I never have been completely well, so when I'm so, to a sucks! They are very specific moments. It is a transitional phase, I become another man for some time. Otherwise, I live a little outside him, I do not know when exactly It comes this, but it comes and finds me. "
-What is the story that hides behind "in white", the most successful song that you have written to today and always closes Natasa Bofilios's live appearances? "It is one of the most magical moments of our cooperation.Cathen A song that had stayed for a long time in the drawer. Oels they said "E, this song is never going to catch". With this very much there are no recipes: it has ten turns, it does not have a refrained, says things that are strange, metaphysically says And very personally. For me all that is mentioned are very specific references to very specific faces, ie I explicitly exped to this song.Arew his way to his music Themis Karamuratidis, who had it in his hands for a long A long time did not see him, but he was strange. But he had to take a scream, he also caught him from the song and so we met in the emotion and naturally after he came to Atasa who took off with her interpretation and made the scream literal, and he initially screamed us in the recording, finally did not cut it. We had discussed her, she came out at that moment in the studio and we had held it. "
-What were not afraid to be expelled so much through your lyrics? "At all! I never afraid there, it is not else. For me it was an open heart surgery this song, left a lot of weight from above me, it was a walk in Peter Rallis, 3 hours at night, imagine even stray dogs had taken me from behind, but I did not hear them because I wore headphones in 2002, somewhere to be written. With lots of distress, it was a period of those you feel that nothing goes Well in your life and all you deny in the most cynical way. It came, then, this idea with dyes-dyes in a row, without the perspective of the song and then I took it from within me, without even recording the thimble And when I came home I sat down and I wrote it. The next day I was another man.Much calmer, much more quiet, so they work. "
-In very often about the difficulty of coming nearly.Why are so difficult to relation today?
"Because we ourselves have become too difficult and we want to identify ourselves through our relationships. When we solve this, relationships will be wonderful! Beautiful, quiet relationships that may not give you the sky with the stars , but a very nice everyday life. But when you start and look for yourself in the other man and you see your pussy enlarged opposite, there is over, the "His lost the game".
- Do you write often for prohibited love. Do you want to blossom and in normal conditions, or we will always need Drama and we will feel cursed poets?
"It is meant that we like the drama very much, explains a lot of unresolved issues that we have with ourselves .If when a man wakes up in the morning and goes to a job that does not want, pays an account that does not want, moves with a medium that does not want In a city that does not want, it is nice to know that he has a tragedy from behind him. While tragedy, of course, not from those who lead you to destruction, but at any time you can get out of it with two-three Glasses of whiskey and a nice song on the radio. A likes, makes us feel alive this thing. And we become a little cinematic heroes, novelists, we like the fairy tale, draws our organization. And, of course, we were born for drama , this is certain".

- Inspiration meets incomprehensible hours, or do you set specific hours when you write? "It depends on what I have to do.Now that I've been working on Fame, it wasn't necessary to have inspiration, because I was pressing on an already good text, so I was actually doing it in office hours, I was saying "now working."But in general my office hours, when I want to make something, are hours when I leave blanks and walk around the streets without a program.I'm on strange streets listening to music, whatever music you can imagine.I usually choose more urban, less idyllic landscapes.I can walk Peter Rally or Piraeus along.I'm redeemed and powered by this process.It gives me the luxury of being abstract, lost.Walking in a straight line without focusing on somewhere in particular.My friends wonder with me for going so long, I eat a lot of work.I've always got a block, and I keep pointing.You think more, I don't write so much lyrics in the notebook, but also in the cell phone and in a paper towel everywhere.Only by spraying on the wall have I not yet written!" -The artifact has passed and still passes a serious "entechnitis" about supposedly sought, incoherent lyrics.You've been considered by many to be an exception..."My songs do not call them arts.I'm writing s-gu-dia.Singing, singing, singing, you can tell them with what you want, what I'm interested in is becoming part of the everyday life of any person who is in touch with his emotion.I don't even care about having code numbers. I don't even care about having a couple-refren-free.I'm interested to be small monologues that a man will get them on his radio or find them on You Tube and say, "Hey, yeah, that's it!"He doesn't want the song.- What songs do you like to hear?"I love those songs very much, i.e. the songs that can talk to you about a cup and even if you don't have such a cup, sharing the foreign cup, I am very moved by whoever does this.That's why I loved so much Mariana Kriezi's lyrics, for example.Marianina Krieze was talking to you about a Panagiotis, you may not have known anyone Panagiotis, and about Serenata her cat and you said "ok, I don't have a cat named Serenata, but the loss so I've experienced her."That's what I think of as a song." -When do you write better, when you're a mess, or when you're a good one? "Never be a complete good one, so when I'm like this, to a mess!It's very specific moments.It's a transition phase, I'm becoming another person for some time.I see the world, I live a little outside of it, I don't know exactly when this comes, but it comes and finds me." -Who's the story behind "En White," the most successful song you've ever written and always closes the live performances of Natasa Bofiliu?"It is one of the most magical moments of our cooperation.First it's a song that had been left in the drawer for a long time.Everyone was saying, "Hey, this song is never gonna work."But that is exactly why there are no recipes: it has ten turns, it has no refreshing, it says things that are strange, metaphysically and very personal.For me all the things that are mentioned are very specific references to very specific persons, i.e. me completely exposed this song.So he found his way with the music of Theme Karamuratides, who, while having it in his hands for a long time, did not swallow with him, seemed strange to him too.But when he also had to make his own cry, he was caught by the song, so we met in the emotion, and then of course Natasa came and took off with her interpretation and made the scream literally, and while she first frightened us in the recording, we didn't cut it off.We hadn't discussed her, she went out in the studio at the time and we kept her." - You weren't afraid to be exposed so much through your lyrics?"Not at all!I'm never afraid of that, I can't help it.For me it was an open heart surgery this song, it left a lot of weight on top of me, it was a walk to Peter Rallie, 3 o'clock at night, to imagine even stray dogs had taken me from behind, but I didn't hear them because I wore headphones, in 2002, somewhere then it had to be written.With a lot of sadness, it was a period of time for those who feel that nothing is going well in your life and everything disguises you in the most cynical way.So I came up with this idea with ribs in a row, without the perspective of the song, and when I pulled it out of me, without even recording it, I remembered it, and when I came home, I sat down and wrote it.The next day I was another person.Much calmer, much more quieter, that's how these work." - You write too often about the difficulty of coming close.Why are relations so difficult today?Because we ourselves have become very difficult and want to identify ourselves through our relationships.When we solve this, relationships will be wonderful!Beautiful, quiet relationships that may not give you the sky with the stars, but a very nice daily life. "But when you start looking for yourself in the other man and you see your doughnuts magnified against you, there it's over, "You've lost the game." -You also often write about forbidden love.Do you think that love can also flourish in normal conditions, or will we always need drama and feel cursed poets? "Sure we like drama very much, explains many unsolved issues we have with ourselves.Because when a man wakes up in the morning and goes to a job he doesn't want, pays an account he doesn't want, moves in an instrument he doesn't want in a city he doesn't want, it's nice to know that there's a tragedy behind it.Which tragedy, of course, is not one of those that leads you to destruction, but at any time you can get out of it with two or three glasses of whiskey and a nice song on the radio.We like it, makes us feel alive this whole thing.And we become a little movie heroes, novelists, we like fairy tale, our body pulls it.And, of course, we were born for the drama, that is for sure."

Original text: 
 
Τα τελευταία χρόνια, τα ταξίδια σε δημοφιλείς προορισμούς τόσο στο εσωτερικό όσο και στο εξωτερικό, αποτελούσαν μια τόσο καταναλωτική όσο και κοινωνική συμπεριφορά των Ελλήνων που συνδέθηκε με την εποχή της ευμάρειας. Τώρα τα πράγματα έχουν αλλάξει. Εσείς συνηθίζετε να πηγαίνετε κάποια ταξίδια μέσα στο χρόνο; Φέτος θα πάτε;
-Τα ταξίδια είναι ουσιαστικά το μόνο έξοδο που επιτρέπω στον εαυτό μου εδώ και καιρό. Ευτυχώς υπάρχουν αρκετές προσφορές πολύ συχνά σε αεροπορικά εισιτήρια. Τα καθημερινά έξοδα ούτως ή άλλως είναι στις περισσότερες χώρες και στην ελληνική επαρχία αρκετά χαμηλότερα από αυτά της Αθήνας οπότε δεν είναι στην πραγματικότητα πολυτέλεια ένα ταξίδι.
Πολλοί έχουν ταυτίσει τα ταξίδια με τα υψηλά έξοδα. Εσείς συνηθίζετε να κάνετε ταξίδια πολυτελείας ή οικονομικά; Υπάρχουν κάποιες συμβουλές που θα δίνατε στους αναγνώστες του kano-oikonomia.gr ώστε να κάνει κανείς οικονομία στις διακοπές του;
- Η αλήθεια είναι ότι ποτέ δεν ήμουν λάτρης των ακριβών ξενοδοχείων. Προτιμώ να μένω σε σπίτια γνωστών ή σε σκηνή, γεγονός που κάνει πιο εύκολη την απόφαση μιας εκδρομής σε κάποια ευρωπαϊκή πρωτεύουσα ή στα όρη και στις θάλασσες της Ελλάδος. Προτείνω ανεπιφύλακτα αεροπορικές εταιρείες όπως η easy jet για φθηνά εισιτήρια, όπως επίσης κι ένα καλό κυνήγι στις ηλεκτρονικές σελίδες για φθηνά εισιτήρια της Aegean ή άλλων εταιρειών. Όσο για τα ελληνικά νησιά, το κατάστρωμα με τον υπνόσακο είναι μια όμορφη και ανέξοδη συνήθεια. Επίσης, υπάρχουν αρκετές ηλεκτρονικές σελίδες ανταλλαγής σπιτιών για όσους δεν έχουν γνωστούς σε κάποιους προορισμούς της αλλοδαπής.
Εσείς ως ταξιδιώτης τι είναι αυτό που περιμένετε να αποκομίσετε από την επαφή σας με έναν άγνωστο τόπο;
-Λατρεύω τα μουσεία και τις πινακοθήκες όπως επίσης και τις μικρές εκπλήξεις που μπορεί να συναντήσεις στα πιο ανυποψίαστα μέρη. Ένα ωραίο κτίριο, μια νέα ιδέα, ένα πρωτοϊδωμένο φαγητό ή ποίημα. Η κάθε χώρα και ο κάθε άνθρωπος φέρει έναν διαφορετικό κώδικα, του οποίου η αποκρυπτογράφηση διευρύνει και τους δικούς μου ορίζοντες, αισθητικούς ή νοητικούς.
Το ταξίδι είναι κάτι που τρέφει τη δημιουργική σας φύση; Και με ποιο τρόπο;
-Προφανώς οι προσμίξεις αντιλήψεων και εμπειριών έχουν δημιουργικό αποτέλεσμα αλλά όντως δεν είναι καθόλου εύκολο να απαντηθεί ο τρόπος με τον οποίο επιτυγχάνεται το τελικό αποτέλεσμα. Πρόκειται συνήθως για τόσο εσωτερική διαδικασία που αν αναλυθεί σημαίνει ότι πρόκειται για νοητικό κατασκεύασμα, άρα δεν καθιστά αυθεντική δημιουργική εμπειρία. Τα δε αποτελέσματα αυτής της διαδικασίας είναι καλό να μην τα περιμένεις αλλά να αφήνεσαι ώσπου να σε επισκεφθούν από μόνα τους. Έτσι έχει νόημα για μένα το ταξίδι. Τουρίστας δεν έχω υπάρξει ποτέ, ώστε να πάρω κάποιες φωτογραφίες για να λέω μετά στους άλλους και στον εαυτό μου τι έχω κάνει. Φαντάζομαι τα ταξίδια μου λειτουργούν πλέον ως μέρος του χαρακτήρα μου, ερήμην.
Σύμφωνα με μία άποψη, που μάλιστα βρίσκει πολλούς αποδέκτες, η κρίση έχει και τα θετικά της. Έφερε πιο κοντά τους ανθρώπους και αφύπνισε ένα αίσθημα αλληλεγγύης που κοιμόταν βαθιά… Πιστεύετε ότι αυτή η άποψη ανταποκρίνεται στην πραγματικότητα; Το διαπιστώνετε αυτό στο επαγγελματικό, κοινωνικό και διαπροσωπικό σας περιβάλλον;
-Είναι αλήθεια ότι αρκετοί άνθρωποι αφυπνίζονται σε δύσκολους καιρούς. Και τώρα παρατηρώ πολλές ομάδες αλλά και άτομα να εμβαθύνουν στην ανάγκη κι όχι στο εφέ. Παρόλα αυτά, υπάρχουν και περιπτώσεις ανθρώπων που έχουν πλέον αποκτηνωθεί ενισχύοντας έναν ανταγωνισμό και “παρτακισμό” άνευ προηγουμένου.
Μια τελευταία τάση που επικρατεί είναι η επιστροφή νέων ανθρώπων στην επαρχία. Σε πρόσφατη συνέντευξή σας είχατε πει ότι δεν θα διστάζατε να επιστρέψετε στο …. χωριό σας. Πιστεύετε ότι η επιστροφή στην επαρχία θα ήταν μια λύση για κάποιους; Υπάρχουν προοπτικές εκεί; Πέρα από την οικονομική αποκατάσταση, κατά τη γνώμη σας, υπάρχει πρόσφορο έδαφος για να δημιουργήσει κανείς και να εκφραστεί;
-Πάντα υπάρχει και παντού. Προφανώς δεν είναι εύκολο για κάποιον που δεν μπορεί να ξεχωρίσει τη βερικοκιά από την κερασιά, ξαφνικά να γίνει καλλιεργητής ή παραγωγός, αλλά σίγουρα όλα αυτά είναι πράγματα που μαθαίνονται και “καλλιεργούνται” όπως η ίδια η γη. Είναι λυπηρό σε μια γεωργοκτηνοτροφική χώρα όπως η Ελλάδα να υποτιμάμε τη χειρονακτική εργασία. Τα αποτελέσματα τα πληρώνουμε τώρα πολύ ακριβά. Επιτρέπεται στη χώρα μας να εισάγουμε ρόδια, μανιτάρια και γαλακτοκομικά προϊόντα;
Σε παλαιότερη συνέντευξή σας είχατε πει πως η ηθοποιία λειτουργεί ψυχοθεραπευτικά. Διευρύνοντας αυτή την άποψη, πιστεύετε ότι η έκφραση και η δημιουργικότητα μπορούν να λειτουργήσουν θετικά προς αυτή την κατεύθυνση;
-Να διευκρινίσω ότι δεν εννοώ ότι ο ηθοποιός κάνει ψυχοθεραπεία επί σκηνής. Αυτό είναι κάτι που απεύχομαι. Απλώς γίνεται το μέσον για να ακουστούν πολλές φωνές μαζί, των θεατών, των προγόνων και των απογόνων. Κι όταν ταυτίζεσαι με μια κοινή φωνή και με το ανθρώπινο πάθημα εν γένει, αυτό λειτουργεί απελευθερωτικά γιατί ξαφνικά συναντιέσαι με μια κοινή ψυχή. Από το μέρος πηγαίνεις στο όλον. Από τη δυαδικότητα στη συνειδητότητα. Κάθε άνθρωπος που κάνει αυτό που του λέει η καρδιά του ως ένα βαθμό ψυχοθεραπεύεται καθώς γίνεται όλο και πιο παρών.
Εν μέσω κρίσης, ποια συμβουλή θα δίνατε σε ένα νέο που θέλει να ξεκινήσει τα πρώτα του βήματα στην ηθοποιία; Πιο ειδικά, αυτή την εποχή θεωρείτε ότι είναι «φρόνιμο», να εγκαταλείψει κανείς την επαρχία για να μετοικίσει σε μια αστική πόλη που βιώνει έντονα την κρίση, διεκδικώντας το όνειρό του;
-Δεν υπάρχουν συμβουλές παρά μόνο αυτό που είπα και πριν. Πρέπει να κάνεις αυτό που λέει η καρδιά σου. Τότε μόνο γίνεσαι δημιουργικός γιατί είσαι και παρών. Όταν κάνουμε, όπως είθισται, πράγματα που δεν μας ικανοποιούν, η αίσθηση και το μυαλό μας είναι αλλού, άρα είμαστε απόντες. Είμαστε ως ένα βαθμό νεκροί εκτός κι αν δημιουργούμε. Και η δημιουργία μπορεί να κρύβεται στην απλή ποιητική μας δράση. Το να θαυμάσεις ένα λουλούδι, να παίξεις με ένα παιδί ή ένα ζώο, να αφήσεις το βλέμμα σου να αρμενίσει στον ουρανό ή σε δυο αγαπημένα μάτια είναι πράξη επίγνωσης. Αν αυτά θα τα κάνεις στην επαρχία ή στο άστυ, αν θα τα κάνεις όντας ηθοποιός ή υπάλληλος, είναι αυστηρά και αδιαπραγμάτευτα επιλογή τού καθενός.

In recent years, traveling to popular destinations both inside and abroad, they were such a consumer and social behavior of the Greeks connected to the time of prosperity. Now things have changed. You get used to going some trips in time ? This year will you go?
- Travel is essentially the only exit that I have been waiting for a long time. We have enough offers very often on airline tickets. Daily expenses anyway are in most countries and the Greek province a fairly lower than those in Athens so it is not In fact luxury a journey.Who have identified travel with high expenses. You are used to luxury travel or finances? Are there any advice you would give to the readers of Kano-oikonomia.gr to be economy in his holidays?
- The truth is that I have never been a fond of expensive hotels. I have to stay in homes known or on stage, making it easier to make a tour of a European capital or the mountains and the seas of Greece. I have unreserved airlines such as Easy Jet for cheap tickets, as well as a good hunt on the online pages for cheap Aegean tickets or other companies. As for the Greek islands, the deck with the sleeping bag is a beautiful and inexpensive habit. Also, there are several electronic exchange pages House for those who have not known to some destinations of the alien. You as a traveler what is what you expect to reap from your contact with an unknown place?
- I love museums and galleries as well as the small surprises you can meet at the most unsuspecting parts. A nice building, a new idea, a private food or poem. Each country and every person carry a different code, whose Decrypt widens and my own horizons, aesthetic or mental. The journey is something that feeds your creative nature? And in what way?
- Attention, impurities and experiences have a creative effect, but it is indeed easy to answer the way the final result is achieved. It is usually for both internal process that if analyzed means that it is a mental construct, so it does not make authentic creative experience Tained.The results of this process are good not to wait for them but to leave until they visit you by themselves. So it makes sense to me the trip. I have never existed, so I get some photos to say after others and to the My self what I have done. I have my travels now operate as part of my character, absentally, in one aspect, which finds many recipients, the crisis also has its positive ones. It is closer to people and awakened a sense of solidarity that Sleep deep ... Do you think this view is actually responding? You find this in your professional, social and interpersonal environment?
- It is true that many people are awakened to difficult times. And I now notice many groups and people to deepen the need and not in the effects. These products, there are also cases of people who have now been gained by reinforcing a competition and "Casting" unprecedented. The last trend that prevails is the return of young people in the province. In the recent interview you had told you that you would not hesitate to return to .... Village you.Cherese that return to the province would be a solution for some? There are prospects there? Beyond economic restoration, in your opinion, there is a good ground to create and express it?
-Where is there and everywhere.Proftly it is not easy for someone who can not distinguish the apricot from Cherry, suddenly become a grower or producer, but surely all these are things that are learned and "grown" like the Earth itself. It is sad In a farming country such as Greece to underestimate the manual work. The results are now paying it very expensive. It goes to our country to import pomegranates, mushrooms and dairy products? In an older interview you had told you that the actor operates psychotherapeutics. Taking this view , Do you think expression and creativity can work positively in this direction?
- I am clarifying that I do not mean that the actor makes psychotherapy on stage. This is something that I am awarded the middle to hear many voices together, viewers, ancestors and offspring. When you identify with a common voice and with the Human Patio In general, this works liberally because you suddenly meet with a shabit. From the place you go to all. From the duality in consciousness.Any man who does what his heart tells him as a degree psychotherapy as it is becoming more and more. In a crisis, which advice you would give a new one who wants to start his first steps in the actress? More specifically, at this time Do you think it is "prudent", to give up the province to be shaken in an urban town that strongly experiences the crisis, claiming his dream?
- There are no advice only what I said before. You can do what your heart says. Only you become creative because you are also present. When we do, as it is concerned, things that do not satisfy us, our feeling and mind is Elsewhere, so we are absent. We are a certain extent dead unless we create. And creating can be hidden in our simple poetic action. To admire a flower, play with a child or an animal, let your look to armn In the sky or in two loved eyes it is an act of awareness.You will do them in the province or at Asty, if you will make them an actor or employee, they are strictly and non-negotiable choice of everyone.

In recent years, travel to popular destinations both internally and abroad have been a consumer and social behaviour of the Greeks associated with the age of prosperity.Now things have changed.Are you used to going on some trips through time?This year you are going? - Travel is basically the only way out that I have been allowing myself for some time.Fortunately there are several offers very often in flight tickets.Daily expenses anyway are in most countries and in the Greek province much lower than those in Athens, so it is not really a luxury trip.Many have identified travels with high expenses.Are there any tips you would give to kano-oikonomia.gr readers to make savings on their holidays? - The truth is I was never a fan of expensive hotels.I prefer to stay in homes known or on stage, which makes it easier to make a trip to a European capital or to the mountains and seas of Greece easier.I propose unconditional airlines such as Easy Jet for cheap tickets, as well as a good hunting on online pages for cheap tickets from Aegean or other companies.As for the Greek islands, the sleeping bag deck is a beautiful and inexpensive habit.Also, there are several electronic home exchange pages for those who have no acquaintances in some foreign destinations.You as a traveler what is it that you expect to get from your contact with an unknown place? - I love museums and galleries as well as the little surprises you may encounter in the most insensitive places.A nice building, a new idea, a novel food or a poem.Each country and every man bears a different code, whose decipher broadens my horizons, aesthetics or mentals.Is the journey something that feeds your creative nature?And in what way? - Obviously, impurities of perceptions and experiences have a creative effect, but it is not at all easy to answer how the final result is achieved.This is usually such an internal process that if analysed means that it is a mental construction, so it does not make it an authentic creative experience.And the results of this procedure are good not to expect them, but to let them visit you on their own.That makes sense to me the journey.Tourist, I've never been so I can take some pictures to tell others and myself what I've done.I imagine my journeys now work as part of my character, absent.According to one view, which many of the addressees even finds, the crisis has its positive effects.It brought people closer together and awakened a feeling of solidarity that was deep asleep... Do you think that view is really correct?Do you see this in your professional, social and interpersonal environment? - Is it true that many people are awakening in difficult times.And now I see many groups and people deepening in need rather than in effect.However, there are also cases of people who have now been acquired by strengthening competition and “parcism” without precedent.A last trend is the return of young people to the province.In a recent interview you said you would not hesitate to return to your... village.Do you think the return to the province would be a solution for some people?Beyond the economic restoration, in your opinion, is there any appropriate ground to create and express itself? - There is always everywhere.Evidently it is not easy for someone who can’t tell the cherries, suddenly becoming a grower or a producer, but certainly all of this is things that are learned and “growled” like the earth itself.It is regrettable that in a farming country like Greece we should underestimate manual work.The results are now very expensive.Is our country allowed to import pomegranates, mushrooms and dairy products?In your earlier interview, you said that the act works psychotherapists.By broadening this view, do you think that expression and creativity can work positively in this direction? - Let me clarify that I don't mean that the actor does psychotherapy on stage.That's something I'm abstaining on.It just becomes the means to hear many voices together, viewers, ancestors and offspring.And when you are identified with a common voice and with a human suffering in general, it works liberatingly because you suddenly meet with a common soul.It's where you're going to the whole place.From binary to consciousness.Every man who does what his heart tells him to a certain extent is healed as he becomes more and more present.In the midst of a crisis, what advice would you give to a young man who wants to start his first steps in the act?More specifically, at this time you think it's "fruitful" to leave the province to move to a urban city that is experiencing the crisis, claiming its dream? - No advice except what I said before.You have to do what your heart says.Then you only become creative because you're here.When we do, as usual, things that do not satisfy us, our sense and mind are elsewhere, so we are absent.We're to a certain extent dead unless we create.And creation can be hidden in our simple poetic action.Admiring a flower, playing with a child or an animal, letting your gaze shine in heaven or in two loved eyes is an act of consciousness.If that's what you do in the province or in the police department, if you do it as an actor or an employee, it's strict and unnegotiable choice.

In recent years, travel to popular destinations both at home and abroad, they were such a consumer and social behavior of the Greeks associated with the time of prosperity. Now things have changed. Are you used to going some trips in time? This year will you go?
- Travel is basically the only exit that I have been waiting for a long time. Luckily there are several offers very often on airline tickets. Everyday expenses are in most countries and the Greek province well below those in Athens, so it is not really a luxury a trip.
Many have identified trips with high expenses. Are you used to making luxury trips or finances? Are there any advice you would give to the readers of Kano-oikonomia.gr to be economy in his holidays?
- The truth is that I have never been a fond of expensive hotels. I prefer to stay in homes known or on stage, making it easier to make a tour to a European capital or the mountains and the seas of Greece. I suggest unreservedly airlines like Easy Jet for cheap tickets as well as a good hunt on the online pages for cheap Aegean tickets or other companies. As for the Greek islands, the deck with the sleeping bag is a beautiful and inexpensive habit. There are also several electronic home exchange pages for those who have not known to some destinations of the alien.
Do you as a traveler what is what you expect to reap from your contact with an unknown place?
- I love museums and galleries as well as the small surprises you can meet at the most unsuspecting parts. A nice building, a new idea, a home-made food or poem. Each country and each person carries a different code, whose decryption broadens my own horizons, aesthetic or mental.
Travel is something that feeds your creative nature? And in which way?
-Προφανώς οι προσμίξεις αντιλήψεων και εμπειριών έχουν δημιουργικό αποτέλεσμα αλλά όντως δεν είναι καθόλου εύκολο να απαντηθεί ο τρόπος με τον οποίο επιτυγχάνεται το τελικό αποτέλεσμα. Πρόκειται συνήθως για τόσο εσωτερική διαδικασία που αν αναλυθεί σημαίνει ότι πρόκειται για νοητικό κατασκεύασμα, άρα δεν καθιστά αυθεντική δημιουργική εμπειρία. Τα δε αποτελέσματα αυτής της διαδικασίας είναι καλό να μην τα περιμένεις αλλά να αφήνεσαι ώσπου να σε επισκεφθούν από μόνα τους. Έτσι έχει νόημα για μένα το ταξίδι. Τουρίστας δεν έχω υπάρξει ποτέ, ώστε να πάρω κάποιες φωτογραφίες για να λέω μετά στους άλλους και στον εαυτό μου τι έχω κάνει. Φαντάζομαι τα ταξίδια μου λειτουργούν πλέον ως μέρος του χαρακτήρα μου, ερήμην.
Σύμφωνα με μία άποψη, που μάλιστα βρίσκει πολλούς αποδέκτες, η κρίση έχει και τα θετικά της. Έφερε πιο κοντά τους ανθρώπους και αφύπνισε ένα αίσθημα αλληλεγγύης που κοιμόταν βαθιά… Πιστεύετε ότι αυτή η άποψη ανταποκρίνεται στην πραγματικότητα; Το διαπιστώνετε αυτό στο επαγγελματικό, κοινωνικό και διαπροσωπικό σας περιβάλλον;
-Είναι αλήθεια ότι αρκετοί άνθρωποι αφυπνίζονται σε δύσκολους καιρούς. Και τώρα παρατηρώ πολλές ομάδες αλλά και άτομα να εμβαθύνουν στην ανάγκη κι όχι στο εφέ. Παρόλα αυτά, υπάρχουν και περιπτώσεις ανθρώπων που έχουν πλέον αποκτηνωθεί ενισχύοντας έναν ανταγωνισμό και “παρτακισμό” άνευ προηγουμένου.
Μια τελευταία τάση που επικρατεί είναι η επιστροφή νέων ανθρώπων στην επαρχία. Σε πρόσφατη συνέντευξή σας είχατε πει ότι δεν θα διστάζατε να επιστρέψετε στο …. χωριό σας. Πιστεύετε ότι η επιστροφή στην επαρχία θα ήταν μια λύση για κάποιους; Υπάρχουν προοπτικές εκεί; Πέρα από την οικονομική αποκατάσταση, κατά τη γνώμη σας, υπάρχει πρόσφορο έδαφος για να δημιουργήσει κανείς και να εκφραστεί;
-Πάντα υπάρχει και παντού. Προφανώς δεν είναι εύκολο για κάποιον που δεν μπορεί να ξεχωρίσει τη βερικοκιά από την κερασιά, ξαφνικά να γίνει καλλιεργητής ή παραγωγός, αλλά σίγουρα όλα αυτά είναι πράγματα που μαθαίνονται και “καλλιεργούνται” όπως η ίδια η γη. Είναι λυπηρό σε μια γεωργοκτηνοτροφική χώρα όπως η Ελλάδα να υποτιμάμε τη χειρονακτική εργασία. Τα αποτελέσματα τα πληρώνουμε τώρα πολύ ακριβά. Επιτρέπεται στη χώρα μας να εισάγουμε ρόδια, μανιτάρια και γαλακτοκομικά προϊόντα;
Σε παλαιότερη συνέντευξή σας είχατε πει πως η ηθοποιία λειτουργεί ψυχοθεραπευτικά. Διευρύνοντας αυτή την άποψη, πιστεύετε ότι η έκφραση και η δημιουργικότητα μπορούν να λειτουργήσουν θετικά προς αυτή την κατεύθυνση;
-Να διευκρινίσω ότι δεν εννοώ ότι ο ηθοποιός κάνει ψυχοθεραπεία επί σκηνής. Αυτό είναι κάτι που απεύχομαι. Απλώς γίνεται το μέσον για να ακουστούν πολλές φωνές μαζί, των θεατών, των προγόνων και των απογόνων. Κι όταν ταυτίζεσαι με μια κοινή φωνή και με το ανθρώπινο πάθημα εν γένει, αυτό λειτουργεί απελευθερωτικά γιατί ξαφνικά συναντιέσαι με μια κοινή ψυχή. Από το μέρος πηγαίνεις στο όλον. Από τη δυαδικότητα στη συνειδητότητα. Κάθε άνθρωπος που κάνει αυτό που του λέει η καρδιά του ως ένα βαθμό ψυχοθεραπεύεται καθώς γίνεται όλο και πιο παρών.
Εν μέσω κρίσης, ποια συμβουλή θα δίνατε σε ένα νέο που θέλει να ξεκινήσει τα πρώτα του βήματα στην ηθοποιία; Πιο ειδικά, αυτή την εποχή θεωρείτε ότι είναι «φρόνιμο», να εγκαταλείψει κανείς την επαρχία για να μετοικίσει σε μια αστική πόλη που βιώνει έντονα την κρίση, διεκδικώντας το όνειρό του;
-Δεν υπάρχουν συμβουλές παρά μόνο αυτό που είπα και πριν. Πρέπει να κάνεις αυτό που λέει η καρδιά σου. Τότε μόνο γίνεσαι δημιουργικός γιατί είσαι και παρών. Όταν κάνουμε, όπως είθισται, πράγματα που δεν μας ικανοποιούν, η αίσθηση και το μυαλό μας είναι αλλού, άρα είμαστε απόντες. Είμαστε ως ένα βαθμό νεκροί εκτός κι αν δημιουργούμε. Και η δημιουργία μπορεί να κρύβεται στην απλή ποιητική μας δράση. Το να θαυμάσεις ένα λουλούδι, να παίξεις με ένα παιδί ή ένα ζώο, να αφήσεις το βλέμμα σου να αρμενίσει στον ουρανό ή σε δυο αγαπημένα μάτια είναι πράξη επίγνωσης. Αν αυτά θα τα κάνεις στην επαρχία ή στο άστυ, αν θα τα κάνεις όντας ηθοποιός ή υπάλληλος, είναι αυστηρά και αδιαπραγμάτευτα επιλογή τού καθενός.

Το φαινόμενο «μπούλινγκ» ή εκφοβισμού ή θυματοποίησης ενός παιδιού, όπως προτιμούν να το ονομάζουν οι Ευρωπαίοι, φυσικά γεννιέται μέσα στα σχολεία. Όπως εξηγεί, μάλιστα, μιλώντας στο www.healthview.gr ο Αναπληρωτής Καθηγητής Παιδοψυχιατρικής κ. Ιωάννης Τσιάντης, «ο εκφοβισμός αποτελεί μορφή επιθετικής συμπεριφοράς που εμφανίζεται κυρίως στη σχολική πραγματικότητα με σοβαρές επιπτώσεις για την ψυχοσυναισθηματική ανάπτυξη του παιδιού και του εφήβου και τη διαδικασία της μάθησης». Ως πρόεδρος, μάλιστα της Εταιρείας Ψυχοκοινωνικής Υγείας του Παιδιού και του Εφήβου (ΕΨΥΠΕ), ο κ. Τσιάντης διακρίνει ότι η επιθετική συμπεριφορά μεταξύ μαθητών εκδηλώνεται όλο και πιο συχνά, όλο και πιο βίαια στα ελληνικά σχολεία.
www.healthview.gr : Μπορεί να υποθέσει κανείς ότι η θυματοποίηση ενός παιδιού, αυτό που οι Αμερικανοί ονομάζουν «μπούλινγκ», έχει διάφορες μορφές;
Ιωάννης Τσιάντης : Πράγματι…Κατ΄ αρχήν έχουμε τον λεκτικό εκφοβισμό, όπως πειράγματα, βρίσιμο, ειρωνική συμπεριφορά, απειλές, διάδοση φημών. Φυσικά έχουμε και σωματικό εκφοβισμό, χτυπήματα, σπρώξιμο, σεξουαλική παρενόχληση, χειρονομίες. Επίσης, έχουμε κοινωνικό εκφοβισμό, όπως αποκλεισμό του παιδιού από τη συμμετοχή σε ομαδικές δραστηριότητες, σε παρέες, παιχνίδια κ.α. Και βέβαια, έχουμε εκφοβισμό μέσα από τα κινητά τηλέφωνα και το διαδίκτυο, τον λεγόμενο ηλεκτρονικό εκφοβισμό.
www.healthview.gr : Πόσο συχνό είναι το φαινόμενο του εκφοβισμού στην Ελλάδα και ποιοι «πρωταγωνιστούν», είτε ως θύτες είτε ως θύματα;
Ιωάννης Τσιάντης : Όπως προκύπτει από τα διεθνή, κυρίως, δεδομένα, το 15% των μαθητών έχουν βιώσει συμπεριφορές εκφοβισμού, οι οποίες παρατηρούνται συχνότερα στα σχολεία στις ηλικίες από 8 έως 15 χρόνων. Τα αγόρια ασκούν σε μεγαλύτερο ποσοστό σωματική βία, ενώ τα κορίτσια εμπλέκονται κυρίως σε περιστατικά λεκτικού εκφοβισμού. Στην ελληνική πραγματικότητα επιδημιολογικές έρευνες έχουν δείξει ότι το φαινόμενο του εκφοβισμού είναι ένα ζήτημα που πλήττει περίπου 1 στα 10 παιδιά. Είναι ενδιαφέρον, μάλιστα, να αναφερθεί ότι στην Ελλάδα παρατηρείται δραματική αύξηση του ποσοστού των παιδιών που υφίστανται εκφοβισμό στο σχολείο, από τη μια τάξη στην άλλη.
www.healthview.gr : Πώς μπορούμε να καταλάβουμε εάν ένα παιδί πέφτει συχνά θύμα εκφοβισμού;
Ιωάννης Τσιάντης : Το παιδί θύμα έχει περισσότερο άγχος, ανασφάλεια, ενώ είναι συνήθως ήσυχο, ευαίσθητο και παραμένει σιωπηλό γι΄ αυτό που του συμβαίνει. Έχει μια αρνητική στάση προς τη βία. Έχει, επίσης, χαμηλή αυτοεκτίμηση, κλαίει εύκολα και δεν μπορεί να υπερασπιστεί τον εαυτό του. Τα παιδιά που πέφτουν θύματα βίας μπορεί να εμφανίζουν κατάθλιψη, να διακατέχονται από ιδέες αυτοκτονίας, ανασφάλεια, άγχος, ψυχοσωματικές εκδηλώσεις, άρνηση να πάνε σχολείο, μαθησιακά προβλήματα και δυσκολίες προσαρμογής.
www.healthview.gr : Αντιστοίχως, πώς μπορούμε να καταλάβουμε εάν ένα παιδί λειτουργεί ως θύτης, εκφοβίζοντας άλλα παιδιά;
Ιωάννης Τσιάντης : Τα παιδιά θύτες νιώθουν την ανάγκη να κυριαρχούν και να ελέγχουν τον άλλον. Φαίνεται να ικανοποιούνται από την πρόκληση πόνου και αδιαφορούν για τα θύματα τους. Είναι παιδιά με χαμηλή σχολική επίδοση και προσπαθούν να ελέγχουν τον άλλον με εκδηλώσεις βίαιης συμπεριφοράς. Τα παιδιά αυτά μπορεί να εκδηλώσουν, επίσης, παραβατική συμπεριφορά, που μπορεί αργότερα στην ενηλικίωση να εξελιχθεί σε εγκληματικότητα.
www.healthview.gr : Πώς μπορεί να ελεγχθεί το φαινόμενο του «μπούλινγκ» σε κεντρικό επίπεδο, αν όχι από τις ίδιες τις οικογένειες των μαθητών;
Ιωάννης Τσιάντης : Λόγω του ότι το φαινόμενο του εκφοβισμού και της θυματοποίησης (bullying) παίρνει διαρκώς αυξανόμενες διαστάσεις στην Ελλάδα, η Εταιρεία Ψυχοκοινωνικής Υγείας του Παιδιού και του Εφήβου εφαρμόζει από το 2006 Ευρωπαϊκό Διακρατικό ερευνητικό πρόγραμμα σε Δημοτικά σχολεία στην Αθήνα και σε Γυμνάσια της Θεσσαλονίκης. Το πρόγραμμα έχει ως στόχο την ενημέρωση και την ευαισθητοποίηση των εκπαιδευτικών, των γονιών και των μαθητών και επιχειρεί να προτείνει κατευθυντήριες οδηγίες με στόχο την πρόληψη του «μπούλινγκ».
www.healthview.gr : Υπήρξαν θετικά συμπεράσματα από την εφαρμογή του προγράμματος;
Ιωάννης Τσιάντης : Οι μαθητές στην Ελλάδα μετά την εφαρμογή του προγράμματος, ανέφεραν ότι έγιναν περισσότερο ικανοί να μιλήσουν για τα περιστατικά της βίας στους εκπαιδευτικούς και τους γονείς και τους συμμαθητές τους και έγιναν πιο ικανοί να αντιμετωπίζουν την επιθετικότητα των άλλων παιδιών. Οι εκπαιδευτικοί, επίσης, αναγνώρισαν την ανάγκη τους για περισσότερη εκπαίδευση και ευαισθητοποίηση καθώς και υποστήριξη για την εφαρμογή του προγράμματος πρόληψης στα σχολεία τους. Το πρόγραμμα προώθησε τις αρχές για καλύτερη επικοινωνία μεταξύ μαθητών, εκπαιδευτικών και γονιών και σεβασμό των ατομικών δικαιωμάτων και των αναγκών των μαθητών, έτσι ώστε εκπαιδευτικοί, μαθητές και γονείς να συμβάλλουν όλοι για ένα σχολείο χωρίς βία.

These children can also manifest delinquent behavior, which can later be adulthood to evolve into crime.
www.healthview.gr: How can the phenomenon of "boiling" can be controlled at central level, if not by the students' families themselves?
Ioannis Tsintis: Because the phenomenon of intimidation and victimization (bullying) takes a constantly growing dimensions in Greece, the child's psychosocial health and teenager company applies from the 2006 European Transnational Research Program to Primary Schools in Athens and High Schools in Thessaloniki Tained. The program aims to inform and raise awareness of teachers, parents and pupils and attempts to propose guidelines aimed at preventing "boiling".
www.healthview.gr: Have there been a positive conclusions from the implementation of the program?
Ioannis Tsintis: Students in Greece after implementing the program, reported that they were more able to talk about the incidents of violence to teachers and parents and their classmates and became more able to deal with the aggression of other children. Teachers also recognized their need for more education and awareness as well as support for the implementation of the prevention program in their schools. The program promoted the principles for better communication between students, educational and parents and respect for the individual rights and students' needs so that teachers, students and parents will all contribute to a school without violence.

The "boiling" or intimidation or victimization of a child, as the Europeans prefer to call it, of course, is born in schools. As he explains, speaking at www.healthview.gr Deputy Professor of Child Psychiatry, Mr. Ioannis Tsintis, "Intimidation is a form of aggressive behavior that occurs mainly on school reality with a serious impact on the psychosonsigning development of the child and the teenager and the process of learning '. As President, the Children's Psychosocial Health Company and Teenager (EFSPE), Mr. Tsintis distinguishes that aggressive behavior between students is happening more and more and more violent in Greek schools.
www.healthview.gr: Can one assume that the victimization of a child, what Americans call "boilings", has different forms?
Ioannis Tsintis: Indeed ... First we have word intimidation, such as teasing, foundation, ironic behavior, threats, spreading of rumors. Of course we also have bodily intimidation, blows, push, sexual harassment, gestures. We also have social intimidation, such as child blocking from participation in group activities, to groups, games, etc. And of course, we have intimidation through mobile phones and the Internet, so-called electronic intimidation.
www.healthview.gr: How common is the phenomenon of intimidation in Greece and who are "starring", either as perpetrators or as victims?
Ioannis Tsiantis: As is apparent from international, especially data, 15% of students have experienced intimidation behaviors, which are most often seen in schools at ages from 8 to 15 years old. Boys exercise in a greater percentage of physical violence, while girls are mainly involved in verbal intimidation incidents. In Greek reality epidemiological surveys have shown that the phenomenon of intimidation is an issue that affects about 1 in 10 children. It is interesting, to mention that in Greece there is a dramatic increase in the percentage of children who suffer intimidation at school, from one class to another.
www.healthview.gr: How can we understand if a child often falls victim to intimidation?
John Tsintis: The child victim has more anxiety, insecurity, and is usually quiet, sensitive and remains silent for what happens to him. Has a negative attitude toward violence. It also has low self-esteem, crying easily and can not defend himself. Children falling victims of violence may experience depression, be divided by suicide ideas, insecurity, anxiety, psychosomatic events, refusal to go to school, learning problems and adaptation difficulties.
www.healthview.gr: Respectively, how can we understand if a child acts as a victor, intimidating other children?
John Tsintis: Children Hosts feel the need to dominate and control each other. They seem to be satisfied by causing pain and indifferent to their victims. They are children with low school performance and try to control each other with violent behavioral events. These children can also manifest delinquent behavior, which can later be adulthood to evolve into crime.

Τα σωζόμενα παραδοσιακά σπίτια της Θάσου χρονολογούνται από το 1800 και μετά. Κτισμένα σε δασωμένες πλαγιές, εμφανίζουν όλα τα στοιχεία της θρακομακεδονικής αρχιτεκτονικής, χωρίς κανένα νησιώτικο. Η εξήγηση πρέπει να αναζητηθεί στη μεγάλη ομοιότητα των παραγόντων που επηρέασαν την κατασκευή των σπιτιών της Θάσου και του ευρύτερου θρακομακεδονικού χώρου: κλίμα, ίδια υλικά κατασκευής (ξύλο και πέτρα), ίδιος τρόπος δόμησης ανά τις εποχές, ίδια σινάφια μετακινουμένων μαστόρων Ηπειρωτών, Αρβανιτών Βουλγάρων αλλά και ντόπιων.
Υπάρχουν, όμως, και ιδιαίτεροι παράγοντες που επιδρούν στην θασίτικη δόμηση. Η απομόνωση του νησιού και ο φόβος εξαιτίας των πειρατών. Η απομόνωση, καθώς το νησί ήταν πειρατικό καταφύγιο και τόπος, από όπου έπαιρναν οι πειρατές ναυπηγήσιμη ξυλεία, δεν επέτρεψε στους Θασίους να επιδοθούν στη ναυτιλία, να πλουτίσουν και να εισάγουν νέες ιδέες. Παρέμεναν στο εσωτερικό φοβισμένοι και, σύμφωνα με τους περιηγητές, μόνο η συνήθεια τούς κρατούσε στο νησί. Η βασική επαφή τους με τον έξω κόσμο ήταν με το Άγιο Όρος. Αλλά, τόσο τα αγιορείτικα μετόχια, όσο και οι εκκλησιές, είναι κτισμένα με τα ίδια υλικά και τεχνικές και, όταν το μέγεθός τους είναι μικρό, συγχέονται με τα θασίτικα σπίτια. Ο πειρατικός κίνδυνος επηρέασε ιδιαίτερα την αρχιτεκτονική των παλαιότερων σπιτιών, η οποία έχει καθαρά αμυντικό χαρακτήρα: πετροντούβαρα, παράθυρα-πολεμίστρες, αμπάρες των θυρών, ελάχιστα ανοίγματα σε προφυλαγμένες θέσεις.
Οι παλαιότεροι οικισμοί της τουρκοκρατίας ήταν το Λιμανχισάρ (Λιμένας, ο μόνος παράλιος), ο Θεολόγος, το Γενιχισάρ (Κάστρο), το Μπουλγάρ (Βουλγάρω, Ραχώνι) και το κάστρο της Κακής Ράχης. Από αυτά ο Λιμένας, το Κάστρο και η Κακή Ράχη ήταν οχυρωμένα. Το 1570 αναφέρεται και το Καζαβίτι, ενώ το 1626 οι Μαριές. Με εξαίρεση τον Λιμένα που κι αυτός εγκαταλείφθηκε το 1770, τα υπόλοιπα βρίσκονται σε έναν εσωτερικό δακτύλιο. Η Παναγία, η Ποταμιά, η Καληράχη, τα Λιμενάρια, οΣωτήρας, ο Αγ. Γεώργιος είναι νεώτερα. Η επιλογή της θέσης τους συνδυάζει την αθέατη από τη θάλασσα ορεινή περιοχή, για προστασία από τους πειρατές (όταν αυτό δεν ήταν δυνατό, επιλεγόταν δυσπρόσιτη θέση), την ύπαρξη νερού σε κοντινή απόσταση, τον σωστό προσανατολισμό, κατά προτίμηση τον νότο, την προστασία από τους ανέμους και την ενδιαφέρουσα θέα. Η μορφή οργάνωσής τους προσαρμόζεται στις δυνατότητες του εδάφους και είναι άλλοτε γραμμική, κατά μήκος ενός κεντρικού άξονα (όπως είναι στο Θεολόγο), ή κεντρική, γύρω από την πλατεία (όπως είναι στο Κάστρο). Οι δρόμοι ήταν λιθόστρωτοι και συντηρούνταν κάθε χρόνο με υποχρεωτική προσωπική εργασία των Θασίων.
Οι κάτοικοι τα πρώτα χρόνια της τουρκοκρατίας ασχολούνται κυρίως με την κτηνοτροφία και την αμπελουργία. Συμπληρωματικά ασχολούνται με τα μελίσσια και άλλα προϊόντα (βρώμη, σύκα, κουκούλια, όσπρια, καρύδια, αμύγδαλα, λινάρι, βελανίδια, πίσσα). Όλες αυτές οι ασχολίες μπορούσαν να γίνουν με ασφάλεια κοντά στα χωριά, μακριά από τη θάλασσα και τους πειρατές. Η ελαιοκαλλιέργεια ήταν περιορισμένη, λόγω της μεγάλης απόστασης των δένδρων από τα χωριά. (…)
Τα νεοκλασικά
Ο νεοκλασικισμός της Θάσου συνδέεται άμεσα με τη δημιουργία των δύο σημαντικότερων παράλιων οικισμών (Λιμένας, Λιμενάρια). Η ανάπτυξη των Λιμεναρίων, που ξεκίνησε το 1902, υπήρξε ραγδαία, εξαιτίας των μεταλλείων τσίγκου που εκμεταλλευόταν η γερμανική εταιρεία Speidel. Η οικονομική ευμάρεια της «ελληνικής Καλιφόρνια», συντελεί στην οικοδόμηση σπιτιών διώροφων και τριώροφων με συμμετρικές όψεις και χρήση στη διακόσμηση κυρίως φυτικών μοτίβων. Η στέγαση γίνεται κυρίως με στέγες με αετώματα που φέρουν γαλλικά κεραμίδια. Στους υπόλοιπους οικισμούς τα σπίτια εμφανίζουν αυστηρό επιδερμικό διάκοσμο με στυλιζαρισμένη γραμμή, τεθλασμένη ή καμπυλόγραμμη διακόσμηση και με απόπειρα μόνο ως προς το πλάσιμο του όγκου και τη διακόσμηση των απολήξεων του κτιρίου. Συχνά, αποσπασματικά στοιχεία συναντούμε και σε παραδοσιακά σπίτια (αετώματα, ξύλινο αετωματικό γείσο στα παράθυρα). Η κατασκευή των τοίχων εξακολουθεί να γίνεται με πέτρα και ξύλο.

The traditional houses of Thassos date back to 1800.Built on forested slopes, they show all elements of the charcoal architecture, without any insular.The explanation should be sought for the great similarity of factors that influenced the construction of the houses of Thassos and the wider carbonate space: climate, the same construction materials (wood and stone), the same way of building during the seasons, the same sinews of removable masturbations Epirus, Arabic Bulgarians and locals.However, there are also particular factors affecting maritime construction.Isolation of the island and fear due to pirates.Isolation, as the island was a pirate shelter and a place where the pirate shipwrecked timber was taken, prevented the Seamen from indulging in shipping, enriching and introducing new ideas.They remained on the inside scared and, according to travelers, only the habit kept them on the island.Their basic contact with the outside world was with Mount Athos.But both the saints, as well as the churches, are built with the same materials and techniques, and when their size is small, they are confused with the marine houses.The piracy risk particularly affected the architecture of older homes, which is purely defensive: petrodua, windows-warfares, doorbars, minimal openings in protected positions.The oldest villages of Turkish rule were Limanhisar (Limas, the only coast), Theologian, Genichisar (Castro), Bulgar (Bulgaro, Rachoni) and the castle of Bad Rachi.Of these, the Port, the Castle and the Bad Rachi were fortified.In 1570 Kazaviti was also mentioned, while in 1626 the Maries.With the exception of the Port, which was abandoned in 1770, the rest are in an inner ring.Panagia, Potamia, Kalyrachi, Limenaria, Sportsa, Agios Georgios are younger.The choice of location combines the seaside spectacular mountainous area, for protection from pirates (when this was not possible, it was chosen as a sloppy position), the existence of water nearby, the right orientation, preferably the south, the protection from the winds and the interesting view.Their form of organization is adapted to the capabilities of the ground and is sometimes linear, along a central axis (as it is in Theologos), or central, around the square (as it is in Castle).The streets were stonestoned and kept each year with compulsory personal work of the Temples.Residents in the first years of Turkish rule are mainly involved in livestock farming and viticulture.Additionally, they deal with bees and other products (oats, figs, cocoons, legumes, walnuts, almonds, flax, oak, tar).All these jobs could be done safely near the villages, away from the sea and the pirates.Olive cultivation was limited, due to the long distance of trees from the villages.(...) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .The neoclassicalsThe neoclassicalism of Thassos is directly linked to the creation of the two most important coastal settlements (Limas, Limenaria).The development of the ports, which began in 1902, was rapid because of the chicory mines operated by the German company Speidel.The economic prosperity of "Greek California", contributes to the construction of two-hour and three-hour houses with symmetrical aspects and use in the decoration of mainly plant patterns.Housing is mainly made with roofs with vents bearing French tiles.In the rest of the settlements, the houses have a strict leather decoration with a stylized line, embroidered or curved decoration and an attempt only to form the volume and decorate the ends of the building.Often, fragmentary elements are also found in traditional homes (erections, wooden eagle nest in the windows).The walls are still built with stone and wood.

Έλενα Μαρούτσου: «Η λογοτεχνία μας υπενθυμίζει ότι υπάρχει ένα κομμάτι κήπου μέσα σε κάθε άνθρωπο»
Μια ιδιαίτερα ξεχωριστή φωνή στην εγχώρια λογοτεχνική κοινότητα αποτελεί η -βραβευμένη με το Αθηναϊκό βραβείο για τη λογοτεχνία- συγγραφέας. Με λόγο ουσιαστικό και ανεπιτήδευτο, μας συστήνεται και μας καταθέτει πηγαία τις απόψεις της στη συνέντευξη που ακολουθεί…
- Αλήθεια, έχετε απαντήσει στο ερώτημα για ποιον λόγο γράφετε;
Φοβάμαι πως αυτή είναι μια από τις ερωτήσεις (όπως το «γιατί κάνεις παιδιά;»), για την οποία είναι λίγο ύποπτο να έχεις την απάντηση.
- «Στη λογοτεχνία η φαντασία μου με έχει υπηρετήσει πιστά και της είμαι ευγνώμων», έχετε αναφέρει σε μια παλαιότερη συνέντευξή σας. Η φαντασία ή τα προσωπικά βιώματα είναι πιο γόνιμο υπέδαφος για έναν συγγραφέα;
Στη δική μου περίπτωση, τα προσωπικά βιώματα είναι σίγουρα το υπέδαφος, το οποίο όμως θα έμενε άγονο, αν δεν ποτιζόταν απ' τη φαντασία, για να καρπίσει. Από μόνα τους, τα προσωπικά βιώματα δεν συνιστούν λογοτεχνία.
- Ποιο θεωρείτε το σημαντικότερο βιβλίο που έχετε διαβάσει;
Δύσκολο να ξεχωρίσω ένα. Κατά καιρούς συνδέθηκα ιδιαίτερα με διάφορα βιβλία, όπως τα μυθιστορήματα του Ντοστογιέφσκι, τα “Σημειωματάρια” του Καμύ, το “Αλεξανδρινό Κουαρτέτο” του Ντάρελ, το “Αναζητώντας το χαμένο χρόνο” του Προυστ, το “Κουτσό” του Κορτάσαρ αλλά και πιο πρόσφατα βιβλία, όπως τα περισσότερα της Γιόκο Ογκάουα και το υπέροχο “Κανείς δεν άναβε τα φώτα” του Φελισμπέρτο Ερνάντες.
- Πώς εξηγείτε το φαινόμενο του συγγραφικού οργασμού που παρατηρείται τα τελευταία χρόνια στη χώρα μας;
Νομίζω πως εξηγείται μέσα στο πλαίσιο της διαφορετικής θέσης και σχέσης που έχει πια η τέχνη με τη ζωή μας. Παλαιότερα ήταν πολύ ξεκάθαρα τα όρια ανάμεσα στον «δημιουργό» και το «κοινό» και η απόσταση που τους χώριζε ήταν δυσδιάβατη. Από τη δεκαετία του εξήντα και μετά, η έκφραση σε οποιονδήποτε τομέα της τέχνης θεωρήθηκε δικαίωμα του καθενός, ο τίτλος του «καλλιτέχνη» και κατ' επέκταση του «λογοτέχνη» ήταν πια προσιτός σε όλο και μεγαλύτερα στρώματα του πληθυσμού. Μια από τις συνέπειες, λοιπόν, υπήρξε κι αυτός ο «συγγραφικός οργασμός», όπως τον ονομάζετε.
- Το διαδίκτυο, με τη διαδραστικότητά του, έβαλε ξανά τους ανθρώπους να γράψουν, μετά από τα παθητικά χρόνια της τηλεόρασης και του ραδιοφώνου. Πιστεύετε κι εσείς πως το νέο μέσο είναι εκείνο που θα αναδείξει τις σημαντικές λογοτεχνικές φωνές του μέλλοντος;
Δεν είμαι πολύ καλή στις προβλέψεις… Κατά την ταπεινή μου γνώμη, οι σημαντικές λογοτεχνικές φωνές κάθε γενιάς θα συνεχίσουν να αναδεικνύονται για μεγάλο ακόμη χρονικό διάστημα μέσα απ' τις οδούς και τους τρόπους που ισχύουν λίγο πολύ και σήμερα (τη δημοσίευση διηγημάτων σε περιοδικά και την έκδοση των βιβλίων τους), καθώς το διαδίκτυο μπορεί να είναι διαδραστικό και προσιτό σε μεγάλο αριθμό νέων στην πλειοψηφία τους ανθρώπων, όμως παραμένει ένας σχετικά «εφήμερος» και «φευγαλέος» τρόπος έκθεσης κι επικοινωνίας, που φοβάμαι πως μέσα του τα κείμενα τείνουν να χάνουν την απαραίτητη βαρύτητά τους..
- Τι ρόλο μπορεί να παίξει η λογοτεχνία -και η τέχνη γενικότερα- σε μια κοινωνία που πλήττεται από την κρίση;
Μπορεί να μας υπενθυμίσει ότι υπάρχει ένα κομμάτι κήπου μέσα σε κάθε άνθρωπο που, όσο πιο έντονα κι αντίξοα είναι τα εξωτερικά καιρικά φαινόμενα της οικονομίας, τόσο αυτό χρήζει φροντίδας, καλλιέργειας, ελπίδας κι επικοινωνίας.
- Για ποιους λόγους πιστεύετε ότι ο πολύς κόσμος αντιλαμβάνεται τους συγγραφείς ως ιδιότυπους ανθρώπους;
Είναι αλήθεια πως είναι πολλά τα στερεότυπα που συνοδεύουν τους συγγραφείς κι ίσως να έχουν τη ρίζα τους στο γεγονός ότι ένας συγγραφέας πιθανόν να χρειάζεται κατά καιρούς (ή και καθημερινά) μεγάλα χρονικά διαστήματα απομόνωσης και προσήλωσης στο έργο του, κάτι που πιθανόν να του έχει κοστίσει τη ρετσινιά του μοναχικού, εσωστρεφούς, ιδιόρρυθμου.
Πιθανόν σε κάποιες περιπτώσεις να ισχύει αυτό, όμως, νομίζω πως, όπως και τα περισσότερα στερεότυπα, κρύβει πίσω του άγνοια κι ίσως λίγο φόβο. Προσωπικά έχω γνωρίσει μια γκάμα συγγραφέων: αστείους, εσωστρεφείς, εγωπαθείς, άλλους σχεδόν ποιητικούς, πολλούς καθησυχαστικά ή βαρετά κανονικούς, κάποιους απρόσμενα αυθεντικούς κι ενδιαφέροντες. Όπως δηλαδή κι οι υπόλοιποι, οι μη συγγραφείς.
- Η επονομαζόμενη «ροζ» γυναικεία λογοτεχνία έχει να προσφέρει κάτι στη λογοτεχνία κατά τη γνώμη σας;
Καθώς πολλά από τα βιβλία αυτά στα οποία αναφέρεστε ανήκουν στα ευπώλητα, υποθέτω πως τονώνουν την ικανότητα των βιβλιοπωλείων να αντεπεξέλθουν οικονομικά, όπως μου τόνισε κάποια υπάλληλος κεντρικού βιβλιοπωλείου, κι έτσι να μπορούν να πουλάνε και τα βιβλία εμάς των υπολοίπων… Άλλη χρησιμότητα δυσκολεύομαι να διακρίνω.
- Διδάσκετε σε σεμινάρια δημιουργικής γραφής, για τα οποία πολύς λόγος γίνεται τελευταία. Ευφυΐα, αφηγηματικό ταλέντο, εργατικότητα: Ιεραρχήστε τα ανάλογα με εκείνο που θεωρείτε ως το σημαντικότερο προτέρημα για έναν νέο συγγραφέα.
Νομίζω πως κάθε συγγραφέας ή δυνάμει συγγραφέας μπορεί να διαθέτει τις ιδιότητες που αναφέρατε σε διαφορετικά ποσοστά, αναπληρώνοντας κι εξισορροπώντας αδυναμίες με αρετές, ο καθένας με τον δικό του τρόπο κι ανάλογα με τον χαρακτήρα και τις συνήθειές του. Αυτό που βρίσκω απαραίτητο, όμως, είναι ο καθένας που καταπιάνεται με τη λογοτεχνία, να αποκτήσει μια πραγματική σχέση μαζί της, να μην τη βλέπει σαν ένα ακόμα χόμπι ή μέθοδο ψυχοθεραπείας, αλλά σαν έναν κόσμο με τον οποίο πρέπει πρώτα να εξοικειωθεί μέσω της ανάγνωσης και μετά να τον κατοικήσει.
- Τι καινούριο ετοιμάζετε αυτόν τον καιρό;
Αυτό που ετοιμάζω πρόκειται να δει το φως της ημέρας πριν από το Πάσχα, αλλά προτιμώ να μην το αποκαλύψω.

- Really, have you answered the question why you are writing?
I'm afraid that this is one of the questions (like "Why do you guys?"), For which it is a bit suspicious of having the answer.
- "In Literature My imagination has served me faithfully and I am grateful," you have mentioned in an older interview. The fantasy or personal experiences is more fruitful for a writer? In my case, personal experiences are definitely the Subsidally, but it would be barren, if it was not smashed by the imagination, to crush. By their own, personal experiences do not constitute literature .- Which one do you consider the most important book you have read?
Difficult to stand out one.What times I was particularly connected with various books, such as Novasky's novels, "Notebooks" by Ku, the "Alexandrine Quartet" by Darel, "Seeking the lost time" of Kortasar But also more recent books, such as most of the Egocau yoko and the wonderful "no one took the lights" of Felperto Enentas.
- How do you explain the phenomenon of the writing orgasm that has been observed in our country in our country? I think it is explained in the context of the different position and relationship that art with our lives. The boundaries were very clear between the "Creator" and The "audience" and the distance that separated them was difficult. From the sixties and then, expression in any field of art was considered to be everyone's right, the title of the "artist" and by extension "writer" was no longer accessible In more and larger layers of the population. From the consequences, therefore, there was also the "writing orgasm" as you call it.

I am not very good in predictions ... In my humble opinion, the important literary voices of every generation will continue to emerge for a long time through the roads and ways that apply pretty much and today (the publication of short stories in magazines and The publication of their books), as the Internet can be interactive and accessible to a large number of young people in the majority of people, but a relatively "ephemeral" and "fleeting" way of exposure and communication, which is afraid that the texts tend to lose their essential gravity ..
- What role can literature play - and art in general - in a society affected by the crisis?
It can remind us that there is a piece of garden in every man who, the more intense and opposite, is the outer weather events of the economy, so much needs care, cultivation, hope and communication.
- Why do you think that a lot of people perceives the authors as peculiar people?
It is true that many stereotypes accompanying the writers and perhaps have their root in the fact that a writer is likely to be timely (or even daily) long intervals of isolation and commitment to his work, which is likely to have cost him The rest of the lonely, introverted, peculiarity. In some cases, however, that, however, I think, like most stereotypes, hide behind ignorance and maybe a bit of fear. Have you known a range of writers: funny, introverted, self-interested, Other almost poetics, many reassuring or boring normal, some unexpected authentic and interesting. That is why the rest, non-authors.
- The so-called "pink" female literature has to offer something in literature in your opinion?

Elena Maroussou: "Literature recalls us that there is a piece of garden in every human"
A particularly distinct voice in the domestic literary community is - found by the Athenian Award for Literature - Author. Referring essential and unpretentious, it is recommended to us and deposit our views in the interview that follows ...
- Really, have you answered the question why you are writing?
I'm afraid that this is one of the questions (like "Why do you guys?"), For which it is a bit suspicious of having the answer.

Οι περισσότεροι από εμάς έχουμε κατανοήσει την αξία και την ανάγκη για μια ισορροπημένη και υγιεινή διατροφή, αλλά, στους σύγχρονους ρυθμούς της ζωής, η επίτευξη αυτού του στόχου μπορεί να αποτελεί δυσεπίλυτο γρίφο. Είναι εύκολο να ακολουθήσεις διατροφικές συμβουλές στην ηρεμία του σπιτιού σου, αλλά όταν περνάς 12 ώρες την ημέρα στο γραφείο, το να συνεχίσεις να διατρέφεσαι υγιεινά είναι ένα μεγάλο καθημερινό στοίχημα. Παρακάτω σας παραθέτουμε μερικές συμβουλές που θα σας βοηθήσουν να τα καταφέρετε:
Σπιτικό φαγητό: Ένα σπιτικό γεύμα είναι πάντα προτιμότερο, καθώς παρασκευάζεται με υλικά που γνωρίζουμε και ελέγχουμε. Αν το πρωί βρίσκεστε σε κατάσταση πίεσης από άποψη χρόνου, βάλτε σε μια σακούλα τροφίμων 5 ή 6 είδη σαλατικών, για να πάρετε στη δουλειά. Προσθέστε και ένα είδος πρωτεΐνης όπως για παράδειγμα μια μικρή κονσέρβα τόνου, ένα βραστό αυγό ή λίγο κοτόπουλο, βοδινό, ή αρνάκι που περίσσεψε από την προηγούμενη μέρα. Αφιερώστε 5 λεπτά για να τα ψιλοκόψετε και ετοιμάστε μια υγιεινή, πλούσια σε πρωτεΐνη σαλάτα για την ώρα που θα πεινάσετε στο γραφείο.
Η μεγάλη αξία των πρωτεϊνών: Αποφύγετε τους πολλούς υδατάνθρακες στο μεσημεριανό γεύμα (ζυμαρικά, ρύζι, ψωμί, νουντλς), καθώς αυτές οι τροφές, ενώ αυξάνουν γρήγορα τη γλυκόζη του αίματος, προκαλούν αργότερα απογευματινή υπογλυκαιμία που μπορεί να σας οδηγήσει στην εύκολη λύση του γλυκού. Η πρωτεΐνη επιβραδύνει την απελευθέρωση σακχάρου από το γεύμα στη κυκλοφορία του αίματος, βοηθώντας έτσι στη διατήρηση σχετικά σταθερών επιπέδων γλυκόζης στο αίμα και μειώνοντας τα ξαφνικά επεισόδια πείνας ('λιγούρες', επιθυμία για γλυκό) και άρα την πιθανότητα να μπείτε στον πειρασμό να καταναλώσετε κάποιο γλυκό.
Μην παραλείπετε το πρωινό: Ένα καλό πρωινό δίνει ενέργεια για το ξεκίνημα της ημέρας μας, πολλοί, όμως, το παραλείπουν λόγω έλλειψης χρόνου. Μην ξεχνάτε ότι τα άτομα που δεν τρώνε πρωινό έχουν την τάση να επιλέγουν ανθυγιεινά σνακ για το δεκατιανό τους και/ή να τρώνε υπερβολικά το μεσημέρι. Αν βιάζεστε, πολτοποιείστε στο μπλέντερ μια μπανάνα με λίγο αποβουτυρωμένο γάλα και πιείτε το ρόφημα στη διαδρομή για το γραφείο! Αν αγοράζετε πρωινό απέξω, επιλέξτε ένα τυλιχτό σάντουιτς ή ένα τοστ με ψωμί ολικής άλεσης.
Κοιμηθείτε καλά το βράδυ: Μην υποτιμάτε την αξία ενός καλού βραδινού ύπνου. Αν σας λείπει ύπνος και αισθάνεστε κουρασμένοι στη δουλειά, θα αναζητάτε το φαγητό σαν πηγή ενέργειας, παρότι στην πραγματικότητα δεν πεινάτε.
Προγραμματίστε τα γέυματά σας: Αν υπάρχει πιθανότητα να μείνετε μέχρι αργά στη δουλειά, μην περιμένετε μέχρι το βράδυ που θα πεινάσετε πολύ, για να σκεφτείτε τι θα φάτε. Εκείνη την ώρα που νιώθετε μεγάλη πείνα, είναι πολύ πιο πιθανό να παραγγείλετε ένα υψηλό σε λιπαρά φαγητό (π.χ. πίτσα) απ’ έξω. Προγραμματίστε από νωρίτερα το δείπνο σας: βγείτε για λίγο έξω το απόγευμα, αγοράστε το βραδινό σας, βάλτε το στο ψυγείο και έτσι θα έχετε έτοιμο το δείπνο σας, όταν έρθει η ώρα που θα πεινάσετε.
Μην υποκύπτετε στον πειρασμό: Αν το πρόχειρο και ανθυγιεινό φαγητό σάς βάζει εύκολα στον πειρασμό, απλά μην το αγοράσετε! Μπορεί όταν αγοράζουμε ένα σακουλάκι με γλυκές ή αλμυρές λιχουδιές ή μια σοκολάτα να είμαστε σίγουροι ότι θα φάμε λίγο ή μόνο σε 'έκτακτη ανάγκη', αλλά το πιο πιθανό είναι τα σνακ αυτά να έχουν τελειώσει, πριν περάσει η μέρα. Ο καλύτερος τρόπος να περικόψουμε τις ζαχαρούχες τροφές είναι να μην τις αγοράζουμε. Αντίθετα, πρέπει να έχουμε πάντα μαζί μας πρόχειρο ένα υγιεινό σνακ. Πάρετε μαζί σας ένα φρούτο ή έχετε λίγους άψητους ξηρούς καρπούς στο συρτάρι σας, για να τσιμπολογάτε ανάμεσα στα γεύματα.
Τα ποτά έχουν θερμιδική αξία: Στην ημερήσια πρόσληψη θερμίδων συμβάλλουν και τα ποτά. Τα σακχαρούχα αναψυκτικά πρέπει οπωσδήποτε να αποφεύγονται αλλά και οι χυμοί φρούτων μπορεί να είναι παραπλανητικοί, γιατί μας φορτώνουν όλες τις θερμίδες του φρούτου, χωρίς να περιέχουν φυτικές ίνες που προάγουν το αίσθημα του κορεσμού για μεγαλύτερο χρονικό διάστημα. Αν διψάτε, πιείτε νερό: Δεν περιέχει καμία θερμίδα και δεν κοστίζει!
Ο καφές μπορεί να σας στοιχίζει ακριβά: Ένας συνηθισμένος καπουτσίνο ή ένας πλήρης 'λάττε' καφές περιέχουν 224 θερμίδες, χωρίς να υπολογίζεται η ζάχαρη που κάποιοι προσθέτουν. Προσπαθήστε να περιορίσετε την ημερήσια κατανάλωση καφέ και οπωσδήποτε ζητήστε να σας τον παρασκευάσουν με αποβουτυρωμένο γάλα που μειώνει τη θερμιδική αξία του κατά 75% σε σχέση με την 'πλήρη' εκδοχή του.
Σνακ κατά τη διάρκεια των συναντήσεων: Αν πρόκειται να πάτε σε μία συνάντηση όπου ξέρετε ότι θα προσφέρονται ανθυγιεινά σνακ, έχετε μαζί σας τη δική σας υγιεινή επιλογή: Ένα μήλο ή λίγοι ξηροί καρποί θα σας βοηθήσουν να αποφύγετε τον πειρασμό.
Ο χρυσός κανόνας: Από τη στιγμή που το στομάχι μας γεμίζει μέχρι τη στιγμή που ο εγκέφαλος αντιλαμβάνεται το αίσθημα του κορεσμού, μεσολαβούν περίπου 10 λεπτά. Έτσι, όταν τρώμε γρήγορα, η ποσότητα τροφής που καταναλώνουμε είναι μεγαλύτερη, και, όταν ο εγκέφαλος αντιληφθεί τον κορεσμό, εμείς ήδη νιώθουμε 'φούσκωμα' και δυσφορία. Αφιερώστε στον εαυτό σας 10 λεπτά ηρεμίας και απολαύστε το γεύμα σας συγκεντρωμένοι μόνο σε αυτό, ακόμα κι όταν τρώτε πάνω στο γραφείο σας. Μασήστε καλά κάθε μπουκιά πριν την καταπιείτε, χαρείτε τη γεύση, τη μυρωδιά και τα χρώματα της τροφής και έχετε κερδίσει ένα διάλειμμα ηρεμίας και ανανέωσης μέσα στη φορτωμένη με υποχρεώσεις ημέρα σας.

Προσθέστε και ένα είδος πρωτεΐνης όπως για παράδειγμα μια μικρή κονσέρβα τόνου, ένα βραστό αυγό ή λίγο κοτόπουλο, βοδινό, ή αρνάκι που περίσσεψε από την προηγούμενη μέρα. Αφιερώστε 5 λεπτά για να τα ψιλοκόψετε και ετοιμάστε μια υγιεινή, πλούσια σε πρωτεΐνη σαλάτα για την ώρα που θα πεινάσετε στο γραφείο.
Η μεγάλη αξία των πρωτεϊνών: Αποφύγετε τους πολλούς υδατάνθρακες στο μεσημεριανό γεύμα (ζυμαρικά, ρύζι, ψωμί, νουντλς), καθώς αυτές οι τροφές, ενώ αυξάνουν γρήγορα τη γλυκόζη του αίματος, προκαλούν αργότερα απογευματινή υπογλυκαιμία που μπορεί να σας οδηγήσει στην εύκολη λύση του γλυκού. Η πρωτεΐνη επιβραδύνει την απελευθέρωση σακχάρου από το γεύμα στη κυκλοφορία του αίματος, βοηθώντας έτσι στη διατήρηση σχετικά σταθερών επιπέδων γλυκόζης στο αίμα και μειώνοντας τα ξαφνικά επεισόδια πείνας ('λιγούρες', επιθυμία για γλυκό) και άρα την πιθανότητα να μπείτε στον πειρασμό να καταναλώσετε κάποιο dessert.
Μην παραλείπετε το πρωινό: Ένα καλό πρωινό δίνει ενέργεια για το ξεκίνημα της ημέρας μας, πολλοί, όμως, το παραλείπουν λόγω έλλειψης χρόνου. Μην ξεχνάτε ότι τα άτομα που δεν τρώνε πρωινό έχουν την τάση να επιλέγουν ανθυγιεινά σνακ για το δεκατιανό τους και/ή να τρώνε υπερβολικά το μεσημέρι. Αν βιάζεστε, πολτοποιείστε στο μπλέντερ μια μπανάνα με λίγο αποβουτυρωμένο γάλα και πιείτε το ρόφημα στη διαδρομή για το γραφείο! Αν αγοράζετε πρωινό απέξω, επιλέξτε ένα τυλιχτό σάντουιτς ή ένα τοστ με ψωμί ολικής άλεσης.
Κοιμηθείτε καλά το βράδυ: Μην υποτιμάτε την αξία ενός καλού βραδινού ύπνου. Αν σας λείπει ύπνος και αισθάνεστε κουρασμένοι στη δουλειά, θα αναζητάτε το φαγητό σαν πηγή ενέργειας, παρότι στην πραγματικότητα δεν πεινάτε.
Προγραμματίστε τα γέυματά σας: Αν υπάρχει πιθανότητα να μείνετε μέχρι αργά στη δουλειά, μην περιμένετε μέχρι το βράδυ που θα πεινάσετε πολύ, για να σκεφτείτε τι θα φάτε. Εκείνη την ώρα που νιώθετε μεγάλη πείνα, είναι πολύ πιο πιθανό να παραγγείλετε ένα υψηλό σε λιπαρά φαγητό (π.χ. πίτσα) απ’ έξω. Προγραμματίστε από νωρίτερα το δείπνο σας: βγείτε για λίγο έξω το απόγευμα, αγοράστε το βραδινό σας, βάλτε το στο ψυγείο και έτσι θα έχετε έτοιμο το δείπνο σας, όταν έρθει η ώρα που θα πεινάσετε.
Μην υποκύπτετε στον πειρασμό: Αν το πρόχειρο και ανθυγιεινό φαγητό σάς βάζει εύκολα στον πειρασμό, απλά μην το αγοράσετε! Μπορεί όταν αγοράζουμε ένα σακουλάκι με γλυκές ή αλμυρές λιχουδιές ή μια σοκολάτα να είμαστε σίγουροι ότι θα φάμε λίγο ή μόνο σε 'έκτακτη ανάγκη', αλλά το πιο πιθανό είναι τα σνακ αυτά να έχουν τελειώσει, πριν περάσει η μέρα. Ο καλύτερος τρόπος να περικόψουμε τις ζαχαρούχες τροφές είναι να μην τις αγοράζουμε. Αντίθετα, πρέπει να έχουμε πάντα μαζί μας πρόχειρο ένα υγιεινό σνακ. Πάρετε μαζί σας ένα φρούτο ή έχετε λίγους άψητους ξηρούς καρπούς στο συρτάρι σας, για να τσιμπολογάτε ανάμεσα στα γεύματα.
Τα ποτά έχουν θερμιδική αξία: Στην ημερήσια πρόσληψη θερμίδων συμβάλλουν και τα ποτά. Τα σακχαρούχα αναψυκτικά πρέπει οπωσδήποτε να αποφεύγονται αλλά και οι χυμοί φρούτων μπορεί να είναι παραπλανητικοί, γιατί μας φορτώνουν όλες τις θερμίδες του φρούτου, χωρίς να περιέχουν φυτικές ίνες που προάγουν το αίσθημα του κορεσμού για μεγαλύτερο χρονικό διάστημα. Αν διψάτε, πιείτε νερό: Δεν περιέχει καμία θερμίδα και δεν κοστίζει!
Ο καφές μπορεί να σας στοιχίζει ακριβά: Ένας συνηθισμένος καπουτσίνο ή ένας πλήρης 'λάττε' καφές περιέχουν 224 θερμίδες, χωρίς να υπολογίζεται η ζάχαρη που κάποιοι προσθέτουν. Προσπαθήστε να περιορίσετε την ημερήσια κατανάλωση καφέ και οπωσδήποτε ζητήστε να σας τον παρασκευάσουν με αποβουτυρωμένο γάλα που μειώνει τη θερμιδική αξία του κατά 75% σε σχέση με την 'πλήρη' εκδοχή του.
Σνακ κατά τη διάρκεια των συναντήσεων: Αν πρόκειται να πάτε σε μία συνάντηση όπου ξέρετε ότι θα προσφέρονται ανθυγιεινά σνακ, έχετε μαζί σας τη δική σας υγιεινή επιλογή: Ένα μήλο ή λίγοι ξηροί καρποί θα σας βοηθήσουν να αποφύγετε τον πειρασμό.
Ο χρυσός κανόνας: Από τη στιγμή που το στομάχι μας γεμίζει μέχρι τη στιγμή που ο εγκέφαλος αντιλαμβάνεται το αίσθημα του κορεσμού, μεσολαβούν περίπου 10 λεπτά. Έτσι, όταν τρώμε γρήγορα, η ποσότητα τροφής που καταναλώνουμε είναι μεγαλύτερη, και, όταν ο εγκέφαλος αντιληφθεί τον κορεσμό, εμείς ήδη νιώθουμε 'φούσκωμα' και δυσφορία. Αφιερώστε στον εαυτό σας 10 λεπτά ηρεμίας και απολαύστε το γεύμα σας συγκεντρωμένοι μόνο σε αυτό, ακόμα κι όταν τρώτε πάνω στο γραφείο σας. Μασήστε καλά κάθε μπουκιά πριν την καταπιείτε, χαρείτε τη γεύση, τη μυρωδιά και τα χρώματα της τροφής και έχετε κερδίσει ένα διάλειμμα ηρεμίας και ανανέωσης μέσα στη φορτωμένη με υποχρεώσεις ημέρα σας.

Όταν ήμασταν στο σχολείο, μικροί και άπειροι μαθητές, φοβόμασταν τα απροειδοποίητα διαγωνίσματα και τις καθιερωμένες εξετάσεις στο τέλος κάθε ακαδημαϊκής χρονιάς. Αλλά και τώρα που μεγαλώσαμε φαίνεται να εξακολουθούμε να φοβόμαστε τις εξετάσεις… τις ιατρικές. Έκτακτες ή τακτικές, οι επισκέψεις στον γιατρό πάντα συνοδεύονται από παρόμοια συναισθήματα - φόβος, αγωνία, άγχος, ανησυχία, μέχρι και πανικός. Όλοι ελπίζουμε να μην εντοπίσει ο γιατρός κάτι ύποπτο, να μην μπούμε στη διαδικασία μιας ασθένειας, μιας θεραπείας, μιας ταλαιπωρίας. Παρόλο που η επιστήμη έχει προοδεύσει και παρέχει τη δυνατότητα να αντιμετωπίσουμε με επιτυχία σχεδόν όλες τις ιατρικές καταστάσεις, ο φόβος του αγνώστου και του μυθοποιημένου κυρίως, καραδοκεί. Πολλοί από εμάς, μάλιστα, βιώνουμε τόσο έντονο, ανεξέλεγκτο και υπερβολικό φόβο που αγγίζει τα όρια της παθολογικής φοβίας, γεγονός που μας προκαλεί δυσλειτουργικές επιπτώσεις στην καθημερινότητα.
Για κάποιους ο φόβος των ασθενειών και των ιατρικών εξετάσεων είναι ικανός να οδηγήσει στην παραμέληση της υγείας. Η ιδέα ότι μπορεί οι εξετάσεις τους να είναι θετικές - και στην υγεία το θετικό πρόσημο δεν θεωρείται καλό – έχει τη δύναμη να παραλύσει κάθε άλλη σκέψη, κάθε ενημέρωση για την αναγκαιότητα του προληπτικού ιατρικού ελέγχου, με αποτέλεσμα να αποφεύγονται οι εξετάσεις, οι γιατροί, ακόμα και οι συζητήσεις για ασθένειες και φάρμακα. Και βέβαια, η αποφυγή μπορεί προσωρινά να δρα ανακουφιστικά, ως ένας μηχανισμός άμυνας, όμως η προστασία αυτή δεν διαρκεί. Οι τύψεις και οι ενοχές κάποια στιγμή χτυπούν την πόρτα της συνείδησης και τότε αναγκαζόμαστε να φέρουμε εις πέρας αυτό που μάταια αποφεύγαμε. Φυσικά, μια τέτοια κατάσταση άγνοιας και αμέλειας μπορεί να είναι τελικά επικίνδυνη για την εξέλιξη μιας ασθένειας. Συνεπώς, καλύτερα να δράσουμε μια ώρα αρχύτερα και να καθιερώσουμε μια ρουτίνα ετήσιων εξετάσεων που θα μας συστήσει ένας γιατρός, τον οποίο εμπιστευόμαστε, και να τηρούμε με συνέπεια τον έλεγχό μας, για να κοιμόμαστε ήσυχοι τα βράδια.
Κάποιους άλλους τους συντροφεύει διαρκώς ο φόβος μην εμφανίσουν κάποια ασθένεια, ο οποίος τους αναγκάζει να ελέγχουν συνέχεια το σώμα τους, για να εντοπίσουν έγκαιρα κάθε πιθανή αλλαγή. Κάθε τέτοια αλλαγή, μικρή ή μεγάλη, από ένα σημάδι στο δέρμα έως ένα φτέρνισμα, το ερμηνεύουν ως βέβαιη ένδειξη συγκεκριμένης ασθένειας. Έτσι, σπεύδουν άμεσα στον γιατρό, για να τους επιβεβαιώσει τη διάγνωσή τους. Φτάνουν μάλιστα στο σημείο να ενημερώνονται για όλες τις ασθένειες, συχνές αλλά και σπάνιες, να διαβάζουν ιατρικές εγκυκλοπαίδειες ή να κατεβάζουν άρθρα- έγκυρα και μη- από το διαδίκτυο προκειμένου να ανακουφίσουν τη νοσηρή πια περιέργειά τους για την ασθένεια. Όμως, μια τέτοια πληροφόρηση, δεν αποτελεί γνώση. Και φυσικά, όποιος διαβάσει ένα εγχειρίδιο παθολογίας δεν γίνεται γιατρός. Συνεπώς, η παραπληροφόρηση αυτού του είδους οδηγεί σε υπερβολικές «διαγνώσεις» και άνευ ουσιαστικού λόγου αγωνία. Καλό είναι να γνωρίζουμε κάποια βασικά στοιχεία που θα έπρεπε να μας θορυβήσουν και να είμαστε υπέρμαχοι του προληπτικού ελέγχου, αλλά μέχρι το σημείο που μας κάνει καλό. Όταν οι ασθένειες και οι εξετάσεις είναι το μόνο που απασχολεί το μυαλό μας, τότε νοσεί το πνεύμα και όχι το σώμα μας.
Συμπερασματικά, λοιπόν, η άγνοια, η αμέλεια, η παραπληροφόρηση και η λανθασμένη κατανόηση σε θέματα ασθενειών, μπορεί να μας προκαλέσει έντονο άγχος και φοβίες για την υγεία μας. Αν τέτοιου είδους σκέψεις καταναλώνουν την ενέργειά μας, είναι προτιμότερο να επισκεφτούμε έναν έμπειρο γιατρό, να μας προτείνει τις απαραίτητες για εμάς ιατρικές εξετάσεις και να αποφασίσουμε ότι θα μείνουμε πιστοί σε αυτή τη ρουτίνα και θα εξοστρακίσουμε κάθε δυσλειτουργική σκέψη από το μυαλό μας. Αν προσπαθήσουμε, αλλά η ψυχολογική μας κατάσταση δεν βελτιώνεται, θα χρειαστεί η συμβολή ενός ειδικού ψυχικής υγείας για την αντιμετώπιση της δυσκολίας μας.

When we were at school, young and inexperienced students, we were afraid of unpredictable tests and established tests at the end of each academic year.But now that we've grown up, we still seem to be afraid of the tests... the medicine.Extraordinary or regular, doctor visits are always accompanied by similar emotions - fear, anxiety, anxiety, and even panic.We all hope that the doctor doesn't find anything suspicious, that we don't get into the process of a disease, a cure, a suffering.Although science has progressed and enables us to successfully deal with almost all medical situations, the fear of the unknown and the excitement, mainly, is carados.Many of us, in fact, experience such intense, uncontrolled and excessive fear that touches the limits of pathological phobias, which causes us dysfunctional effects on everyday life.For some, the fear of diseases and medical examinations is capable of leading to neglect of health.The idea that their tests may be positive – and in health the positive sign is not considered good – has the power to paralyse any other thoughts, any information about the necessity of preventive medical testing, and thus avoiding examinations, doctors, and even the discussions on diseases and medicines.Of course, avoidance can temporarily act as a defence mechanism, but such protection does not last.Remorse and guilt at some point knock on the door of consciousness and then we are forced to accomplish what we have in vainly avoided.Of course, such a state of ignorance and negligence can ultimately be dangerous to the development of a disease.Therefore, we should act an hour earlier and establish a routine of annual examinations that will be introduced by a doctor, whom we trust, and consistently respect our control, so that we can sleep at night.Some others constantly accompany fear from a disease, which forces them to keep track of their bodies, to detect any possible changes in time.Any such change, small or large, from a mark on the skin to a sneeze, interpret it as a sure indication of a specific disease.So, they immediately rush to the doctor to confirm their diagnosis.They even reach the point of being informed about all the diseases, often and rarely, of reading medical encyclopedias or downloading articles, valid and non-reliable from the Internet, in order to alleviate their morbid curiosity about the disease.But such information is not knowledgeable.And of course, anyone who reads a pathology manual can't be a doctor.Therefore, this kind of misinformation leads to excessive ‘diagnosis’ and no substantive reason for anxiety.It is good to know some basic elements that should be noisy and to be protagonists of preventive control, but to the point where it is good for us.When diseases and tests are the only thing that is concerned with our minds, then it is afflicting our spirit and not our body.In conclusion, ignorance, negligence, misinformation and misconception of diseases can cause us intense anxiety and fear of our health.If such thoughts consume our energy, it is preferable to visit an experienced doctor, suggest us the medical tests necessary for us and decide that we will stay faithful to this routine and destroy any dysfunctional thought from our minds.If we try, but our psychological situation does not improve, we will need the contribution of a mental health specialist to cope with our difficulty.

Η λέξη Μυστήριο στην αρχαία Ελλάδα σήμαινε το απόρρητο, το μυστικό, το άρρητο μέρος μιας λατρείας, η οποία δε γινόταν φανερή σε άτομα που δεν είχαν μυηθεί. Όπως φαίνεται και ετυμολογικά, η λέξη παράγεται από το αρχαίο ρήμα «μυείν», δηλαδή κλείνω, και αναφέρεται κυρίως στα μάτια και στα χείλη. Εκείνοι που μυούνταν στα μυστήρια, απαγορευόταν να τα ανακοινώνουν σε άλλους μη μυημένους, δηλαδή, έπρεπε να κλείνουν το στόμα τους.
Τα αρχαία Μυστήρια ήταν ίσως η ανώτερη πνευματική κληρονομιά στην αρχαία Ελλάδα. Ήταν κυρίως κρυφές λατρείες, όπου έπρεπε πρώτα κανείς να μυηθεί, κοινώς να εισαχθεί. Ο οπαδός αυτής της λατρείας ονομαζόταν Μύστης και το πρόσωπο που τον εισήγαγε σ’ αυτή Μυσταγωγός. Κάθε μυστηριακή κοινότητα είχε κοινά γεύματα, κοινούς χορούς και ιεροτελεστίες και οι άνθρωποι που έσμιγαν στα ίδια δρώμενα ένιωθαν για πάντα ενωμένοι.
Από τα λίγα που γνωρίζουμε για αυτά, φαίνεται ότι παρουσίαζαν αλληγορικές αναπαραστάσεις που συμβόλιζαν τα πεπρωμένα των ψυχών μετά θάνατον, το νόμο και την ενότητα που συνδέουν όλα τα όντα. Επίσης, ήταν τελετουργίες για την ευκαρπία της γης, για την πολυπόθητη βροχή. Και υπήρχαν πάντα τοπικά μυστήρια, αλλά και Μυστήρια που απόκτησαν πανελλήνια εμβέλεια όπως τα Ελευσίνια, τα Ορφικά, τα Κρητικά και τα Καβείρια.
Τα Ελευσίνια Μυστήρια περιστρέφονταν γύρω από μια θεότητα, η οποία πολύ νωρίς, πρώτη ίσως από όλους τους άλλους θεούς, προσείλκυσε την προσοχή του ανθρώπου. Μολονότι οι περισσότεροι από τους αρχαίους λαούς φαντάζονταν τους θεούς τους να κατοικούν στον ουρανό, η θεότητα της γης είναι πολύ παλαιότερη. Αποκαλούμενη στην αρχαία ελληνική «Γαία», με το πέρασμα των αιώνων, απέκτησε το όνομα Δήμητρα, το οποίο πιθανότατα προέρχεται από το «Γη μήτηρ». Η λατρεία της Δήμητρας, με καθαρά αγροτικό χαρακτήρα, συνδεδεμένη με τον κύκλο των εργασιών από τη σπορά ως τη συγκομιδή, είχε ευρύτατη διάδοση σε όλο τον ελληνισμό. Έχοντας ως αφετηρία τις εύφορες πεδιάδες της νότιας Θεσσαλίας, εξαπλώθηκε σε όλη την Ελλάδα. Όμως η λαμπρότερη γιορτή προς τιμή της Δήμητρας γινόταν στην Ελευσίνα, στο περίφημο ιερό, όπου τελούνταν τα πιο σημαντικά μυστήρια της αρχαιότητας, στα οποία η Δήμητρα λατρευόταν ως πανίσχυρη θεά. Οι μυστικές αυτές τελετές φαίνεται ότι ήταν μέρος της λατρείας των Πελασγών, των οποίων η θρησκεία περιστρεφόταν γύρω από τη γη, τις χθόνιες θεότητές της, το μυστήριο της ζωής και του θανάτου και της μετά θάνατον ζωής.
Τα μυστήρια, λοιπόν, της Ελευσίνας είναι η θρησκεία των κατακτηθέντων Πελασγών, οι τελετές της οποίας, εξαιτίας του φόβου των επιδρομέων, γίνονταν σε μυστικές συναθροίσεις. Αν και αρχικά η θρησκεία των προελληνικών φύλων υπέστη τους διωγμούς των κατακτητών, με το πέρασμα του χρόνου οι θρησκευτικές τελετές και οι δοξασίες κατακτητών και κατακτημένων αφομοιώθηκαν. Πριν από την κάθοδο των ελληνικών φύλων, τα Ελευσίνια Μυστήρια υπάγονταν στη δικαιοδοσία των προελληνικών βασιλικών οίκων της περιοχής. Γύρω στον 7ο αιώνα π.Χ. ξέσπασαν μακροχρόνιοι πόλεμοι μεταξύ Αθηναίων και Ελευσίνιων. Τελικά, οι Ελευσίνιοι ηττήθηκαν και η Ελευσίνα έγινε ένας από τους Δήμους της Αττικής.
Οι Αθηναίοι ανέλαβαν τη διοίκηση και την εποπτεία των Μυστηρίων, όμως, η Ελευσίνα παρέμεινε η κύρια κοιτίδα τους, ενώ τα ιερατικά αξιώματα και η ευθύνη για τη διοργάνωση των τελετών παρέμεινε στα χέρια των βασιλικών γενών των Ελευσίνιων στους οποίους ανήκε πάντα ο ανώτατος λειτουργός, ο ιεροφάντης.

The word mystery in ancient Greece meant confidentiality, the secret, the wrong part of a worship, which was not obvious to people who had not been initiated. As it seems etymologically, the word is produced by the ancient verb "Myrine", that is, I close, And it is mainly referred to in the eyes and lips. In the mysteries, it was forbidden to announce them to other non-initiates, that is, they had to close their mouths. Ancient mysteries were probably the superior spiritual heritage in ancient Greece. It was mainly hidden cults , where no one first had to be initiated, commonly introduced. The follower of this worship was called Mysti and the person who introduced him a mystery. Social community had common meals, common dances and rituals and people who torn in the same events felt Forever united. From the few we know about them, they seem to have allegorical representations that symbolized the destiny of souls after death, law and unity that connect all beings. They were rituals for Euclin the Earth, for the coveted rain. And there were always local mysteries, as well as mysteries who acquired Pan-Hellenic Range such as Eleusiness, Orphics, Cretan and Caverns. Eleusinia Mysteries revolved around a deity, which very early, first perhaps by all the other gods, attracted man's attention. Most of the ancient peoples imagined their gods to reside in heaven, the deity of the earth is much older. In the ancient Greek "Gaia", over the centuries, he acquired the name Dimitra, which is probably coming from the "Men's Earth". The worship of Demeter, with a purely rural nature, connected to the circle of work by sowing to the Harvest, it had a wide spread throughout Hellenism.

The word Mystery in ancient Greece meant the secrecy, the secret, the inseparable part of a worship, which was not seen in people who were not inclined.As it turns out, the word is produced by the ancient verb "mymin", i.e. I close, mainly referred to the eyes and lips.Those who were smelling in the mysteries were forbidden to announce them to other non-indigenous, or, in other words, they had to shut their mouths.Ancient Mysteries were perhaps the highest spiritual heritage in ancient Greece.They were mainly secret worshipes, where one had to be injected first, commonly introduced.The follower of this worship was named Mystis and the person who introduced him into it a Mystic conductor.Each mysterious community had common meals, common dances and rituals, and the people who gleaned at the same events felt for ever united.Of the few we know about them, they seem to have presented allegorical representations that symbolized the destiny of souls after death, the law and the unity that connect all beings.Also, they were rituals for the euphoria of the earth, for the long - suffering rain.And there have always been local mysteries, but also mysteries that have acquired full-scale Greek range like Elefsinia, Orphics, Cretans and Caveria.Elefsin Mysteries revolved around a goddess, which very early, perhaps first of all of all other gods, attracted man’s attention.Although most of the ancient peoples imagined their gods living in heaven, the goddess of the earth is much older.It is called the ancient Greek "Agia", with the passing of the centuries, it has acquired the name Dimitra, which probably comes from the "Earth mother".The worship of Demetra, with a purely agricultural character, associated with the turnover of the works from sowing to harvest, was widely disseminated throughout Hellenism.Having as the starting point the fertile plains of southern Thessaly, it spread throughout Greece.But the most brilliant celebration in honor of Demetra was in Elefsina, in the famous sanctuary, where the most important mysteries of antiquity were held, in which Dimitra was worshiped as a mighty goddess.These secret ceremonies seem to have been part of the worship of the Pelasgians, whose religion revolved around the earth, its earthly goddess, the mystery of life and death and the afterlife.So Elefsina’s mysteries are the religion of conquered Pelasgians, whose ceremonies, because of fear of invaders, were held at secret meetings.Although the religion of the pre-Greek genders was initially persecuted by the conquerors, over time religious ceremonies and beliefs of conquerors and conquered were assimilated.Prior to the descent of the Greek sexes, the Eleusine Mysteries were subject to the jurisdiction of the pre-Greek royal houses of the region.Around the 7th century BC, long-term wars broke out between Athenians and Elefsini.Eventually, the Eleusinians were defeated and Eleusina became one of the municipalities of Attica.The Athenians took over the command and supervision of the Mysteries, but Eleusina remained their main dormant, while the priesthoods and responsibility for organising the ceremonies remained in the hands of the royal generations of the Eleusines to whom the senior minister, the priest, belonged.

The word mystery in ancient Greece meant confidentiality, the secret, the wrong part of a worship, which was not evident in people who had not been initiated. As it is also etymologically, the word is produced by the ancient verb "Myrine", that is, I close, and refers mainly to the eyes and lips. Those who musded in the mysteries were forbidden to announce them to other non-initiates, that is, they had to close their mouths.
The ancient mysteries were perhaps the superior spiritual heritage in ancient Greece. It was mainly hidden cults where one first had to be initiated, commonly introduced. The fan of this worship was named Myis and the person who introduced him to this mystery. Each mysterious community had common meals, common dances and rituals and people who have been harvested in the same events felt forever united.
Of the few we know about them, they seem to have allegorical representations that symbolized the destiny of the souls after death, the law and unity that connect all beings. Also, they were rituals for Euclin the Earth, for the coveted rain. And there were always local mysteries, but also mysteries who acquired Pan-Hellenic Scope such as Eleusiness, Orphics, Cretan and Cavernia.
Eleusinian mysteries revolved around a deity, which very early, first perhaps from all other gods, attracted man's attention. Although most of the ancient peoples imagined their gods to reside in the sky, the deity of the earth is much older. Called in ancient Greek "Gaia", over the centuries, acquired the name Dimitra, which is probably coming from the "Men Earth". The worship of Demeter, with a purely rural nature, linked to the circle of tasks from sowing to the harvest, had a widespread dissemination throughout Hellenism. With the starting point, the fertile plains of South Thessaly, spread all over Greece. But the brightest celebration in honor of Demeter was done in Elefsina, at the famous sanctuary, where the most important mysteries of antiquity were taken, in which Demeter was worshiped as a powerful goddess. These secret ceremonies seem to be part of the Pelasgian worship, whose religion rotated around the Earth, her chthonian deity, the mystery of life and death and after death.
The mysteries, then, Elefsina is the religion of conquered pulses, whose ceremonies, due to the fear of raiders, were made in secret gatherings. Although the religion of pre-Hellenic sexes suffered the persecution of the conquerors, with the passage of religious ceremonies and the beliefs of conquerors and conquered assimilated. Before the Greek gender cathode, Eleusinia mysteries were subject to the jurisdiction of the pre-Hellenic Royal Houses of the region. Around the 7th century BC They broke long-term wars between Athenians and Eleusian. Ultimately, Eleusian defeated Elefsina became one of the municipalities of Attica.
The Athenians undertook the administration and supervision of mysteries, but Elefsina remained their main cradle, while the priestly awareness and responsibility for organizing the ceremonies remained in the hands of the royal generations of Eleusian to whom the maximum officer always belonged, hierophant.

Αγαπητές ακροάτριες και αγαπητοί ακροατές, με αφορμή την έκθεση με έργα του Δομήνικου Θεοτοκόπουλου που φιλοξενεί αυτές τις μέρες η Εθνική Πινακοθήκη, θα σας μιλήσω στη σημερινή μας εκπομπή για τη ζωή και το έργο αυτού του μεγάλου ζωγράφου – ενός από τους πιο ανήσυχους και αινιγματικούς ζωγράφους όλων των εποχών.
Γεννήθηκε το 1541 στο Ηράκλειο της ενετοκρατούμενης Κρήτης, όπου έλαβε τα πρώτα μαθήματα ζωγραφικής και δέχτηκε τις επιδράσεις των Κρητών ζωγράφων καθώς και της βυζαντινής τέχνης. Το 1566 πηγαίνει στη Βενετία και μαθητεύει στο εργαστήριο του Τιτσιάνο όπου αφομοιώνει τη δυτική τάση στη ζωγραφική, αργότερα στη Ρώμη και τελικά στο Τολέδο της Ισπανίας το 1577. Εκεί πήρε και το όνομα «Ελ Γκρέκο».
Τα έργα του Δομήνικου Θεοτοκόπουλου περιέχουν κάτι το ασυνήθιστο, κάτι που δεν είναι εύκολο να ερμηνευτεί. Η αισθητική στην οποία στηρίζονται είναι ιδιόμορφη και οι προθέσεις του φαίνονται ανεξιχνίαστες αλλά και ο ίδιος ο δημιουργός τους περικλείει γύρω του ένα μυστήριο που αντιστέκεται στις εύκολες ερμηνείες. Οι πραγματείες του για τη φιλοσοφία, τη θεολογία, τη λειτουργική, την αγιολογία, τη λογοτεχνία και την ιστορία έχουν χαθεί. Ωστόσο, το ενδιαφέρον του Δομήνικου Θεοτοκόπουλου για όλα αυτά φαίνεται τόσο από τον κατάλογο των έργων της βιβλιοθήκης του όσο και από τις συναναστροφές του με τους φιλοσοφικούς κύκλους στην Ισπανία. Από τα βιβλία του φαίνεται το ενδιαφέρον του για τους αρχαίους κλασικούς αλλά και για την Πλατωνική και Νεοπλατωνική φιλοσοφία. Για να μπορέσουμε να κατανοήσουμε την τέχνη του Δομήνικου Θεοτοκόπουλου, θα πρέπει να εμβαθύνουμε στις φιλοσοφικές και θρησκευτικές του αντιλήψεις, οι οποίες αντανακλώνται στα έργα του με βαθιά εσωτερικότητα και έντονο το συμβολικό στοιχείο. Είναι γνωστές οι εξαϋλωμένες, πέρα από το συνηθισμένο, μορφές του. Σε όλο το θρησκευτικό έργο του Δομήνικου Θεοτοκόπουλου μπορούμε να διακρίνουμε τον διαχωρισμό του υλικού απ’ τον ουράνιο κόσμο αλλά και την προσπάθειά του να ενώσει σταδιακά, μέσα απ’ το χρώμα και το φως, το γήινο με το υπερβατικό.
Στα έργα του η ατμόσφαιρα του θαύματος δημιουργείται μ’ έναν εκπληκτικό χειρισμό φωτός και χρώματος. Για παράδειγμα, στο διάσημο έργο του «Η Ταφή του Κόμη Οργάθ» οι εκφράσεις στα πρόσωπα των παρευρισκομένων είναι εκστατικές και τα σώματά τους φαίνονται να αιωρούνται ανάμεσα στον γήινο και τον ουράνιο κόσμο, όχι μόνο ως απλοί μάρτυρες αλλά και ως κοινωνοί. Ο άγγελος, ο οποίος ενώνει τη γη με τον ουρανό, βρίσκεται στον κεντρικό άξονα της σύνθεσης και ανεβαίνει, στριφογυρίζοντας προς τον ουρανό, για να μεταφέρει την ψυχή του κόμη, η οποία έχει τη μορφή παιδιού. Το ουράνιο πλήθος το οποίο υπάρχει δίπλα στον Χριστό, έχει μορφές έντονα επιμήκεις και το φως που υπάρχει γύρω τους γίνεται υπερβολικά λαμπερό, μέχρι που καταλήγει σε μια ακτίνα φωτός.
Αυτή η ιεράρχηση του χρώματος και του φωτός, αλλά και των μορφών, από το γήινο προς το ουράνιο, το οποίο υπάρχει και σ’ άλλους πίνακές του, όπως στην Ανάσταση, στη Σταύρωση, στον Ευαγγελισμό κ.α., η ύπαρξη του μεσολαβητή αγγέλου, η ψυχή που αποδεσμεύεται και επιστρέφει εκεί από όπου προήλθε, μας παραπέμπουν στην Πλατωνική και Νεοπλατωνική δομή σκέψης, στην ύπαρξη των δύο κόσμων, του αισθητού και του ιδεατού και την επιστροφή της ψυχής μετά τον θάνατο στον κόσμο των ιδεών. Τα υπερφυσικά μεγέθη του Χριστού, της Παναγίας και των αγγέλων σε σχέση με τα άλλα πρόσωπα που υπάρχουν στους πίνακές του, δείχνουν την ουράνια ιεραρχία, κάτι που υποστήριζε ο Διονύσιος ο Αρεοπαγίτης, βιβλία του οποίου βρέθηκαν στη βιβλιοθήκη του Δομήνικου Θεοτοκόπουλου. Αυτή η ιεράρχηση φαίνεται καθαρά στο έργο του «Η Βάπτιση του Χριστού». Η στενόμακρη φόρμα που συναντάται σε πολλούς πίνακές του με θρησκευτικό περιεχόμενο είναι χαρακτηριστική. Μ’ αυτόν τον τρόπο υπερβαίνει τη φυσική πραγματικότητα και δημιουργεί μια ψευδαίσθηση μορφών που αιωρούνται.
Πολλές φορές βλέπουμε μια παραμόρφωση στο χρώμα και τη φόρμα, έντονη επιμήκυνση των μορφών, με κεφάλια πολύ μικρά σε σχέση με το σώμα, έτσι που στο τέλος οι μορφές να φαίνονται σαν να είναι σε μια διάχυτη κατάσταση. Όταν ενώνονται δε με το έντονο φως, μοιάζουν με φλόγες. Αυτή η έντονη απεικόνιση του φωτός, παραπέμπει στη πνευματική φώτιση, όπως ο ίδιος αναφέρει για τον πίνακά του «Άποψη και Χάρτης του Τολέδο». Η απογύμνωση της μορφής από την ύλη και η σύλληψη μέσω του νου μιας ανώτερης πραγματικότητας, καταργούν τον τόπο και τον χρόνο στους θρησκευτικούς του πίνακες και ο ίδιος έρχεται σε αντίθεση με την αριστοτελική άποψη ότι η μορφή και η ύλη είναι αναπόσπαστα ενωμένες.
Ένα άλλο χαρακτηριστικό σύμβολο που παρατηρούμε, είναι το χέρι του Χριστού που ακουμπάει στο στήθος με τα δάχτυλα ανοιχτά, ενώ ο μέσος και ο παράμεσος είναι ενωμένοι. Αυτό φαίνεται σε αρκετούς πίνακες όπως: «Ο Διαμερισμός των Ιματίων», «Ο Άγιος Φραγκίσκος», κ.ά. Ο τελετουργικός χαρακτήρας των παραστάσεών του, η έννοια της ιεραρχίας, το μεταφυσικό φως, η εξαΰλωση των μορφών, η συμβολική χρήση των χρωμάτων, η ανύψωση προς το πνευματικό στοιχείο, συνθέτουν το συνολικό έργο του μεγάλου ζωγράφου, ο οποίος πέθανε το 1614.
Μετά τον θάνατό του κάποιοι τον χαρακτήρισαν τρελό και δυσνόητο. Ο «Ελ Γκρέκο», όμως, υπήρξε παράδειγμα πνευματικού ατόμου και μεγάλου καλλιτέχνη που κατόρθωσε να μεταφέρει τον πλούσιο εσωτερικό του κόσμο στους θαυμάσιους πίνακές του, μοναδικούς στο είδος τους.
Στο σημείο αυτό ολοκληρώνουμε την αναφορά μας στον Θεοτοκόπουλο και σας θυμίζουμε ότι η έκθεση με τα έργα του θα παραμείνει ανοικτή έως τις 30 Ιανουαρίου. Αξίζει να την επισκεφτείτε!

Dear hearers and dear listeners, on the occasion of the exhibition with Dominikos Theotokopoulos, which hosts these days the National Gallery, I will talk to us in our current show for the life and work of this great painter - one of the most anxious and enigmatic painters of all time. It was in 1541 in Heraklion, Venetian Kritis, where he received the first painting lessons and accepted the effects of Cretan painters as well as Byzantine Art. The 1566 goes to Venice and apprentices in Titsiano laboratory where he assimilates the western trend in painting , later in Rome and eventually in Toledo, Spain in 1577. He took the name "El Greco". The works of Dominikos Theotokopoulos contain something unusual, which is not easy to interpret. The aesthetics on which they rely are peculiar and the Its intentions seem unchecked but also the creator himself surrounds a mystery that resists HIS Interpretations. Its treatises for philosophy, theology, functional, hagiology, literature and history have been lost. His associates with the philosophical cycles in Spain. From his books, he seems to be interested in the ancient classics but also for Platonic and Neoplatonic Philosophy. To understand the art of Dominos Theotokopoulos, we should deepen the philosophical and religious Its perceptions, which are reflected in its projects with deep internality and intense symbolic element. It is well known, beyond its ordinary forms. In all the religious work of Dominikos Theotokopoulos, we can distinguish the separation of heavenly material world but also his attempt to gradually join, through the color and light, the earthly with the transatle His projects The atmosphere of the miracle is created with a surprising light and color treatment. For example, in the famous work of "Burial Synthology", expressions on persons of attendees are ecstatic and their bodies seem to be suspended between the Earth and the celestial world, not only as simple witnesses but also as social.The Angel, who joins the earth with the sky, is located on the central axis of the composition and rises, twinkling to the sky to transport the soul of Komos, which is in the form of a child. The celestial crowd next to Christ , has shapes strongly elongate and the light that exists around them becomes too shiny until it results in a radius of light. This hierarchy of color and light, but also the forms, from the earth to the uranium, which there is also a Its other paintings, such as the resurrection, the crucifixion, the Evangelism, etc., the existence of the Angel Mediator, the soul released and returning there from where they came to, they refer to the Platonic and Neoplatonic thinking structure in the existence of the two worlds , the sensible and ideal and the return of the soul after death in the world of ideas. The supernatural sizes of Christ, Panagia and Angels in relation to other persons present in his paintings, show the N Heaven Hierarchy, something that Dionysios supported Areopagitis, books of which were found in the Library of Dominikos Theotokopoulos. This hierarchy seems clearly in his work "The Baptism of Christ". The narrow form that is found in many paintings with religious content is typical. This way goes beyond physical reality and creates an illusion of forms floating. Older times, we see a distortion in color and form, intense elongation of forms, with heads very small relative to the body, so that in the end Forms appear as if they are in a diffuse condition. When they join the bright light, they look like flames. This intense display of light refers to spiritual enlightenment, as he says for his painting "Toledo View and Map" .The stripping of shape from matter and conception through the mind of a higher reality, abolish the place and time to its religious paintings and the same It contrasts with the Aristotelian view that the shape and matter are integral to united. Another characteristic symbol we observe, is the hand of Christ that leans on the chest with the fingers open, while the average and the parameto are united.This is seen in several paintings such as: "The division of the windows", "St. Francis", etc. The ritual character of his performances, the concept of hierarchy, metaphysical light, the elevation of forms, symbolic use of colors, lifting to the spiritual element, make up the total work of the Great Painter, who died in 1614. Death some of them were crazy and tricky. "El Greco, however, was an example of a spiritual person and a large artist who managed to transfer his rich interior to his wonderful paintings, unique in their kind. In this place, we complete our reference In Theotokopoulos and we remind you that the exhibition with his works will remain open until January 30th. It's worth visiting!

Dear listeners and dear listeners, on the occasion of the exhibition of Domenikos Theotokopoulos' works hosted by the National Gallery, I will speak to you in today's show about the life and work of this great painter – one of the most restless and enigmatic painters of all times.Born in 1541 in Heraklion, in the republic of Crete, where he received the first painting lessons and accepted the effects of Cretan painters as well as Byzantine art.In 1566 he goes to Venice and learns at the Titian workshop where he assimilates the western trend in painting, later in Rome and eventually in Toledo, Spain in 1577.That's where he got the name "El Greco".Domenic Theotokopoulos’ works contain something unusual, which is not easy to interpret.The aesthetic on which they rely is peculiar and its intentions seem unsolved, but their creator himself encloses around a mystery that resists easy interpretations.His affairs about philosophy, theology, functionality, sainting, literature and history have been lost.However, the interest of Dominikos Theotokopoulos in all of this is seen both from the list of works of his library and from his associations with philosophical circles in Spain.His books show his interest in ancient classical and Platonic and Neoplatonic philosophy.In order to be able to understand the art of Dominikopoulou, we should deepen our philosophical and religious concepts, which are reflected in its works with deep internality and a strong symbolic element.It is known that, apart from normal forms, the depleted forms are known.Throughout the religious work of Dominikos Theotokopoulos, we can see the separation of material from the heavenly world as well as its attempt to gradually unite, through colour and light, the earthly with the transcendent.In his works, the atmosphere of the miracle is created with a stunning handling of light and color.For example, in his famous work "The Burial of the Count Orath" the expressions on the faces of the attendees are ecstatic and their bodies seem to be hovering between the earth and the heavenly world, not only as mere witnesses but also as societies.The angel, who joins the earth with the sky, is at the main axis of the composition and rises, twisting toward heaven, to carry his soul of the count, which is in the form of a child.The heavenly crowd that exists next to Christ has forms of intense elongations and the light around them becomes too bright, until it ends up in a radius of light.This hierarchy of color and light, but also of forms, from the earthly to the uranium, which also exists in other paintings, such as the Resurrection, the Crucifixion, the Evangelism, etc., the existence of the mediator angel, the soul that is released and returned where it came from, refer us to the Platonic and Neoplatonic thinking structure, the existence of the two worlds, the aesthetic and the ideal and the return of the soul after death in the world of ideas.The supernatural sizes of Christ, Panagia and angels in relation to the other persons present in his paintings show the heavenly hierarchy, which Dionysius the Areopagite supported, whose books were found in Domenicos Theotokopoulos’s library.This hierarchy is clearly seen in his work "The Baptism of Christ".The narrow form in many of his paintings with religious content is characteristic.In this way it goes beyond natural reality and creates an illusion of forms hovering.Many times we see a deformation in color and form, intense prolongation of forms, with very small heads compared to the body, so that at the end the forms look like they are in a diffuse state.And when they are joined with bright light, they look like flames.This intense display of light refers to spiritual enlightenment, as he mentions in his painting "Visitation and Map of Toledo".Desolation of the form from matter and conception through the mind of a higher reality, abolish the place and time in its religious paintings and he contradicts the aristotle view that the form and matter are inextricably united.Another characteristic symbol that we observe is the hand of Christ who touches the chest with the fingers open, while the middle and the paradox are united.This can be seen in several tables, such as: "The Dividing of the Diamonds", "Saint Francis", etc.The ritual character of his performances, the concept of hierarchy, metaphysical light, the depletion of forms, the symbolic use of colors, the elevation to the spiritual element, compose the overall work of the great painter, who died in 1614.After his death, some people called him crazy and incomprehensible."El Greco", however, was an example of a spiritual individual and great artist who managed to transfer his rich inner world to his wonderful paintings, unique in their kind.At this point we conclude our reference to Theotokopoulos and remind you that the report with its works will remain open until 30 January.It's worth a visit!

Τα ελληνικά κεντήματα – δεν αναφέρομαι βέβαια στη σύγχρονη παραγωγή – εκφράζουν με απόλυτη πληρότητα έναν ολόκληρο κόσμο τον ελληνικό κόσμο που, μετά από την πτώση του Βυζαντίου και έως τη συνταρακτική εποποιία του 1821, όταν ορίζεται τελεσίδικα η ανιούσα της πολιτιστικής του πορείας, αναπλάθει τα δεδομένα της παλιότερης παράδοσης μέσα στο κρυστάλλωμα της νέας του φυσιογνωμίας: το ήθος και οι αξίες, το μέγεθος και οι αρετές, η ιδιομορφία της αισθαντικότητας, στοιχεία από το γενικότερο πνεύμα που διέπει τη μεγάλη αυτή ιστορική περίοδο, αποτυπωμένα χάρη στην υπομονή της γυναικείας ευαισθησίας. Για να νιώσει ωστόσο κανείς σήμερα ένα κέντημα, ξεπερνώντας το επίπεδο του θαυμασμού για τη χειροτεχνική του τελειότητα, χρειάζεται έναν ανάλογα αυξημένο δείκτη ευαισθησίας. Τότε μόνο μπορεί να διαβάσει τους έμμεσα ιστορημένους πόθους και τις ευχές του ελληνικού λαού, τους αγώνες και τα οράματά του, τη σχέση του με τη θάλασσα και το ταξίδι, μια ομηρική διάθεση φυγής δεμένη με την προσδοκία της επιστροφής στο ανθισμένο περιβάλλον ενός φανταστικού χώρου. Πανάρχαια σύμβολα, ριζωμένα στη συλλογική μνήμη, αναβιώνουν εμψυχωμένα από μια δυνατή ερωτική πνοή, το λουλούδι, το καράβι, η ανθρώπινη μορφή, η τερατόμορφη ζωική παρουσία, η απειλή του κακού, η αποτροπαϊκή ευχή, ενθαρρυντικά κελαηδίσματα, ο ύμνος στην ευγονία. Οι αναφορές που περιέχουν τα διάφορα θέματα είναι αναγνώσιμες, διατυπωμένες με το στέρεο αισθητικό λεξιλόγιο της συλλογικής ζωής, με μια κρυστάλλινη διαύγεια και χωρίς ίχνος περιττής πολυλογίας ή συναισθηματισμού. Μορφές αγλαϊσμένες από την αφαιρετική όραση που εντοπίζει και εδώ το καίριο συστατικό, προϋποθέτοντας μια ανάλογη δυναμική διαδικασία από την πλευρά του θεατή και επιβεβαιώνοντας παράλληλα την ποιότητα της δικής του αντίληψης.
Τα ελληνικά κεντήματα αντανακλούν το μέγεθος μιας ιστορικής περιόδου, που ο απόηχός της, στα κατάβαθα της σημερινής συνείδησης, πικρίζει σαν ένας καημός. Και πάλι ο «καημός της Ρωμηοσύνης», όπως θα ‘λεγε ο ποιητής. Σήμερα στη θέση του ηρωικού μεγέθους, της μυθικής διάστασης και της μεθυστικής λατρείας για τη ζωή – αξίες «χειροποίητες» και αγιασμένες – οι εκφραστικές αναζητήσεις, βοηθημένες από την απαιδευσία, τα πονηρά έντυπα και την εμπορία του κακού γούστου, παραπαίουν ανάμεσα σε φύσεις νεκρές και σε συνομιλίες μελίρρυτων μαρκησιών. Το αισθητήριο μόνο «με καιρό και με κόπο» θα μπορούσε να αφυπνισθεί. Για να μεταγραφεί η ευαισθησία των στοιχείων της παραδοσιακής κληρονομιάς και να μεταφυτευθούν εμπλουτισμένες οι αξίες τους στη σημερινή πραγματικότητα, για να μελετηθούν οι αναπλαστικές δυνατότητες της καλλιτεχνικής της έκφρασης πάνω σε νέα υλικά και σε νέες τεχνικές, για να βρεθούν καινούργιοι χρηστικοί τρόποι και να προσαρμοστεί ο χρόνος που απαιτεί η επεξεργασία τους στις διαστάσεις της σημερινής τους αξίας, χρειάζεται και κόπος και δουλειά. Στην ευρύτερη προσπάθεια που καταβάλλεται ας είναι και το βιβλίο «Σχέδια από ελληνικά κεντήματα», που εκδίδει το Μουσείο Μπενάκη, μια προσφορά.
Τα σχέδια που παρουσιάζονται σε αυτό τον τόμο είναι σύγχρονες εφαρμογές παραδοσιακών θεμάτων και αποτελούν μέρος μιας εργασίας που έχει αρχίσει από καιρό και που ακόμη συνεχίζεται. Σκοπός της είναι να συλλεχθούν όσο γίνεται περισσότερα δείγματα – με βάση την τεχνική της μετρητής βελονιάς – απ’ όλες σχεδόν τις περιοχές της χώρας.
Από όλες τις βελονιές που δούλεψαν οι ελληνίδες γυναίκες, προτιμήθηκε η σταυροβελονιά, γιατί είναι γνωστή από παλιά και στον τόπο μας αλλά και σ’ άλλες χώρες. Για να υπάρχει ομοιομορφία στην εμφάνιση και σύγκριση των διαστάσεων, η υπεύθυνη λαογράφος μεταχειρίστηκε πάντα τα ίδια υλικά. Περιορίστηκε σε βιομηχανοποιημένο καμβά και τυποποιημένη ποιότητα μαλλιών, με την ιδέα να απλοποιήσει το πρόβλημα των σύγχρονων ανθρώπων, που δεν υφαίνουν πια στον αργαλειό κι ούτε βάφουν στο καζάνι τους μετάξια και βαμβακερά.

Original text: 
 
Το 2012 συμπληρώθηκαν 200 χρόνια από τη γέννηση του Βρετανού συγγραφέα Κάρολου Ντίκενς. Για τους περισσότερους αναγνώστες σε όλο τον κόσμο ο Ντίκενς είναι ο μπαμπάς του Όλιβερ Τουίστ, ο άνθρωπος που περιέγραψε τον ζοφερό κόσμο της παιδικής εκμετάλλευσης και φτώχειας στην Αγγλία του 19ου αιώνα, έναν κόσμο που θέλαμε να πιστεύουμε ότι έχει για πάντα χαθεί.
Άλλωστε, στον 21ο αιώνα, υποτίθεται ότι όταν μιλάμε για παιδική εργασία και εκμετάλλευση, αναφερόμαστε στον Τρίτο Κόσμο, ότι στην Ευρώπη αυτό το φαινόμενο έχει εξαλειφθεί. Κι όμως, στην πλούσια Γηραιά Ήπειρο, της υποχρεωτικής εννεατούς εκπαίδευσης για τα παιδιά, η παιδική εργασία δεν εξαφανίστηκε ποτέ και τώρα με την κρίση αυγαταίνει. Σχεδόν καμία ευρωπαϊκή χώρα δεν στέλνει όλα τα παιδιά της στο σχολείο, αλλά τα μεγαλύτερα ποσοστά παιδικής εργασίας συναντώνται στις χώρες της ανατολικής Ευρώπης και όλο και περισσότερο στις χώρες του Νότου.
Στην Ελλάδα, εκτιμάται ότι κάθε χρόνο 10.000 παιδιά εγκαταλείπουν το σχολείο και μάλιστα την υποχρεωτική εκπαίδευση. Τα στοιχεία για την παιδική εργασία που αναφέρονται δεν αντικατοπτρίζουν την πραγματική εικόνα, καθώς δεν υπάρχει συστηματική παρακολούθηση του φαινομένου στην πλειοψηφία των κρατών, όπως και στη χώρα μας. Άλλωστε, οι αριθμοί δεν θα μπορούσαν να είναι ακριβείς, όταν καταμετρούν παιδικές ψυχικές «πληγές». Τις περισσότερες, μάλιστα, φορές υπεύθυνοι είναι οι ίδιοι οι γονείς. Γονείς, για τους οποίους η τιμωρία δεν ήρθε ποτέ. Φαίνεται πως η πραγματικότητα κατέστησε επιτακτική την ανάγκη για την καθιέρωση της 12ης Ιουνίου ως της Παγκόσμιας Ημέρας κατά της παιδικής εργασίας και ειδικότερα κατά του περιορισμού της παράνομης διακίνησης παιδιών, από το Διεθνή Οργανισμό Εργασίας.
Η ισχύουσα ελληνική νομοθεσία για την εργασία των ανηλίκων είναι προσαρμοσμένη στις διατάξεις της 138ης διεθνούς σύμβασης εργασίας, σύμφωνα με την οποία επιτρέπεται σε παιδιά άνω των 14 ετών να εκτελούν ελαφρές εργασίες. Για τις προσπάθειες καθορισμού προϋποθέσεων εργασίας των ανηλίκων συντάχθηκε προεδρικό διάταγμα που αφορά κάθε ανήλικο κάτω των 18 ετών. Σύμφωνα με αυτό, ορίζεται ως παιδί, κάθε νέος που δεν έχει συμπληρώσει το 15ο έτος της ηλικίας του ή όποιος νέος υπόκειται ακόμα σε υποχρεωτική σχολική φοίτηση.
Παράλληλα, απαγορεύεται η εργασία των παιδιών, εκτός αυτών που έχουν συμπληρώσει το 13ο έτος της ηλικίας τους - κατόπιν αδείας της Επιθεώρησης Εργασίας - και μπορούν να εργαστούν υπό προϋποθέσεις σε καλλιτεχνικές εκδηλώσεις, διαφημιστικά προγράμματα, επιδείξεις μόδας, ραδιοφωνικές ή τηλεοπτικές εγγραφές. Επιπλέον, το Π.Δ. απαγορεύει την υπερωριακή και νυχτερινή απασχόληση από τις 10.00 το βράδυ έως τις 06.00 το πρωί των νέων κάτω των 18 ετών. Θέτει όρους εργασίας προστατεύοντας τους ανήλικους από ειδικούς κινδύνους - φυσικούς, βιολογικούς και χημικούς παράγοντες - τους οποίους διατρέχει η υγιεινή, η ασφάλεια και ανάπτυξή τους. Τι γίνεται όμως στην πραγματικότητα;
Υπολογίζεται ότι τα εργαζόμενα ανήλικα παιδιά, σύμφωνα με στοιχεία του Διεθνή Οργανισμού Εργασίας, αγγίζουν τα 246 εκατομμύρια ανά τον κόσμο, από τα οποία τα 171 εκατομμύρια εργάζονται κάτω από επικίνδυνες συνθήκες, χωρίς την τήρηση των στοιχειωδών κανόνων υγιεινής και ασφάλειας. Στην Ελλάδα, εκτιμάται ότι κάθε χρόνο 10.000 παιδιά εγκαταλείπουν το σχολείο και μάλιστα την υποχρεωτική εκπαίδευση, ενώ συναντάμε περίπου 50.000 παιδιά να δουλεύουν σε εργοστάσια, χωράφια και καταστήματα.
Η μαθητική διαρροή, που αποκαλύπτει ο πίνακας, συνδέεται άμεσα με την παιδική εργασία, αφού σύμφωνα με έρευνα του Παιδαγωγικού Ινστιτούτου, επτά στους δέκα μαθητές που εγκαταλείπουν το σχολείο βρίσκουν διέξοδο σε βοηθητικές εργασίες. Το πρόβλημα παραμένει οξύ σε ορεινούς νομούς της κεντρικής και δυτικής ηπειρωτικής Ελλάδας και στα νησιά. Η φτώχεια, ο άνισες εκπαιδευτικές δυνατότητες κατά γεωγραφική περιοχή, το αρνητικό οικογενειακό περιβάλλον και η προκατάληψη απέναντι σε συγκεκριμένες κοινωνικές ομάδες εντείνουν τα φαινόμενα κοινωνικής παθογένειας, μέσα στα οποία εντάσσεται και η παιδική εργασία και εκμετάλλευση.

In 2012, 200 years were completed since the birth of British writer Carolo Dickens.For most readers around the world Dickens is Oliver Twist's dad, the man who described the grim world of child exploitation and poverty in the 19th-century England, a world that we wanted to believe has been lost forever.After all, in the 21st century, when we talk about child labour and exploitation, we are talking about the Third World, that in Europe this phenomenon has disappeared.And yet, in the rich continent, of compulsory nine-year-old education for children, child labour has never disappeared and now with the crisis it is getting sick.Nearly no European country sends all its children to school, but the highest rates of child labour are in the countries of Eastern Europe and more and more in the countries of the South.In Greece, it is estimated that every year 10,000 children leave school and even compulsory education.The data on child labour reported do not reflect the real picture, as there is no systematic monitoring of the phenomenon in the majority of states as well as in our country.After all, the numbers could not be accurate when counting children's psychic 'floods'.Most of the time parents themselves are responsible.Parents, for whom punishment never came.It seems that reality has made it imperative to establish 12 June as World Day against Child labour, and particularly against the restriction of child trafficking by the International Labour Organisation.The current Greek legislation on the labour of minors is adapted to the provisions of the 138th International Labour Convention, which allows children over 14 to carry out light work.A presidential decree on every child under 18 has been drawn up for efforts to define terms of work for minors.According to this, it is defined as a child, any young person who has not completed the 15th year of his or her age or whoever is still subject to compulsory schooling.At the same time, the work of children, other than those who have completed the 13th year of their age - on the basis of the work inspectorate's permission - is prohibited and can work under conditions of artistic events, advertising programs, fashion shows, radio or television recordings.In addition, the FC forbids overtime and night work from 10.00 a.m. to 06.00 a.m. in the morning of young people under 18.It sets working conditions to protect minors from special risks - physical, biological and chemical factors - which are responsible for their hygiene, safety and development.It is estimated that the working children of minors, according to data from the International Labour Organisation, reach 246 million worldwide, of which 171 million work under dangerous conditions, without complying with minimum health and safety standards.In Greece, it is estimated that 10,000 children leave school every year and even compulsory education, while there are some 50,000 children working in factories, fields and shops.The pupil leak, revealed in the table, is directly linked to child labour, since according to research by the Pedagogical Institute, seven out of ten students leaving school find a way out of auxiliary work.The problem remains acute in mountainous Prefectures of Central and Western Continental Greece and in the islands.Poverty, unequal educational opportunities by geographical area, the negative family environment and prejudice against specific social groups are intensified by the phenomena of social dignity, including child labour and exploitation.

According to this, it is defined as a child, every young person who has not completed his 15th year or whoever is still subject to mandatory schooling.
At the same time, children are forbidden, other than those who have reached their 13th year - following a labor inspection - and can work under conditions on artistic events, promotional programs, fashion demonstrations, radio or television registrations. In addition, the PD It prohibits overtime and nightly employment from 10.00 in the evening to 06.00 in the morning of young people under 18 years of age. It sets working conditions by protecting minors from specific hazards - natural, biological and chemical factors - their hygiene, safety and development. But what happens in reality?
It is estimated that worker minor children, according to international labor agency, touching 246 million around the world, of which 171 million work under dangerous conditions without compliance with minimum hygiene and safety rules. In Greece, it is estimated that every year 10,000 children leave school and indeed compulsory education, while we meet about 50,000 children to work in factories, farmland and shops.
Student leakage, revealing the table, is directly linked to child labor, since according to a research by the Pedagogical Institute, seven to ten school leaving students find a way out of auxiliary work. The problem remains acute in mountainous prefectures of Central and Western mainland Greece and the islands. Poverty, unequal educational capabilities by geographical area, the negative family environment and bias opposite specific social groups intensify social pathogenes' phenomena, within which child labor and exploitation is also part of.

Μυρίζονται τον κίνδυνο, δεν ακούνε Μπετόβεν, βλέπουν χρώματα, είναι ντροπαλά και γεύονται με τις ρίζες.
Οι πέντε αισθήσεις δεν είναι αποκλειστικό προνόμιο των ζώων. Τα φυτά μεγαλώνουν στο «σωστό» κάθε φορά σημείο, ακριβώς γιατί έχουν ανάλογες αισθήσεις. Για να επιβιώσουν μετρούν τη διάρκεια της ημέρας, ελέγχουν τη θερμοκρασία και την υγρασία. Πώς όμως αισθάνονται τις… αισθήσεις; Στα ζώα υπάρχει το δίκτυο των φλεβών του αίματος, το νευρικό σύστημα κ.λπ. Στα φυτά; Το ανεξερεύνητο αυτό πεδίο ανακαλύπτεται σιγά σιγά από τους επιστήμονες. Ένας ολόκληρος κόσμος από κινήσεις, κατευθύνσεις ανάπτυξης και αλλαγές μεταβολισμού συνδέεται τελικά με τις ευαισθησίες των αισθήσεων.
Αντιδρούν στο άγγιγμα
Τα φυτά είναι… ντροπαλά. Μόλις τα αγγίζουμε «ανατριχιάζουν». Σε λιγότερα από 1.000 είδη, η αντίδραση στην αφή είναι άμεση. Το σαρκοφάγο φυτό κλείνει την παγίδα του, η μιμόζα αναδιπλώνει τα φύλλα της, η τσουκνίδα θραύει τα τριχίδιά της προκαλώντας μας κνίδωση. Όμως, στη μεγάλη πλειοψηφία των 240.000 ανθοφόρων φυτών, οι αντιδράσεις είναι αργές και περιορισμένες.
Όταν εκδηλωθεί κάποιο γεγονός που το φυτό αντιλαμβάνεται ως επίθεση, ένα ηλεκτρικό κύμα διατρέχει την κυτταρική μεμβράνη. Η ροή των ιόντων μεταβάλλει την ευκαμψία και τη διαπερατότητα της μεμβράνης, όπως συμβαίνει και στους ανθρώπινους νευρώνες. Τα ιόντα ασβεστίου πλημμυρίζουν το εσωτερικό του κυττάρου. Παράλληλα με τη ροή ασβεστίου, ενεργοποιούνται κατάλληλα γονίδια, τα οποία χαρακτηρίζονται ως «γονίδια αφής». Οι μιμόζες έχουν στη βάση των φύλλων τους ένα ιδιαίτερο εξόγκωμα του μίσχου τους, το λεγόμενο και προσκεφάλι. Αυτό το όργανο προκαλεί εξαιρετικά γρήγορες αντιδράσεις -σε κλάσματα του δευτερολέπτου- σε κάποιο άγγιγμα ή στις μεταβολές του φωτός. Η μιμόζα χρειάζεται μέχρι και τριάντα λεπτά για να επιστρέψει στη αρχική της θέση.
Βλέπουν τα χρώματα
Μπορούμε να μιλάμε για όραση στα φυτά; Με μία έννοια ναι, γιατί τα φυτά δεν ξεχωρίζουν μόνο την ένταση του φωτός, αλλά -μέσω των χρωστικών ουσιών τους- μπορούν να αντιλαμβάνονται και τις διαφορετικές του συχνότητες. Οι χρωστικές ουσίες είναι δύο ειδών: τα φυτοχρώματα, που είναι ευαίσθητα στις αποχρώσεις του κόκκινου και στα κρυπτοχρώματα που ευαισθητοποιούνται στο μπλε. Ας δούμε όμως πώς λειτουργούν:
Το φυτόχρωμα παίρνει δύο διαφορετικές μορφές, ανάλογα με το αν υπερτερεί το σκούρο ή το ανοιχτό κόκκινο στις ακτίνες που δέχεται. Οι δύο μορφές είναι παρούσες ταυτόχρονα, αλλά σε κάθε περίοδο του 24ωρου κάποια υπερισχύει. Στο φως της μέρας, ευνοείται εκείνη που η απορροφητικότητά της κορυφώνεται στο σκούρο κόκκινο. Τα συγκεκριμένα φυτοχρώματα ευνοούν τη βλάστηση των σπόρων, εμποδίζουν την επιμήκυνση του κορμού ή του βλαστού, ενεργοποιούν τη διαδικασία σύνθεσης της χλωροφύλλης. Ωθούν δηλαδή το φυτό στο να γίνει στιβαρό, φυλλώδες και πράσινο στο μέγιστο των δυνατοτήτων του. Αυτό αλλάζει εάν το φυτό βρεθεί στη σκιά, ακόμα και στη σκιά άλλων φυτών. Στην περίπτωση αυτή η χρωστική ουσία απορροφά το ανοικτό κόκκινο και αντανακλά το σκούρο. Έτσι, οι κορμοί επιμηκύνονται και τείνουν να βγουν από τη σκιά.
Η «υπερένταση» που προκαλεί αυτός ο ανταγωνισμός και το διαρκές ύψωμα του πήχυ έχουν αρνητικά αποτελέσματα στη γεωργία, αφού η υπερπροσπάθεια για ανάπτυξη σε ύψος, καθυστερεί την ανάπτυξη φύλλων, βολβού και σπόρων.
Αισθάνονται τη γεύση με τις ρίζες
Η γεύση αποδεικνύεται επίσης πολύτιμος σύμμαχος των φυτών. Οι ρίζες, για παράδειγμα, που εισχωρούν στο έδαφος, είναι καταδικασμένες να κινούνται στο σκοτάδι. Όπως ο άνθρωπος που έχει χάσει τη όρασή του αναπτύσσει άλλες αισθήσεις, έτσι οι ρίζες αναπτύσσουν τη γεύση. Όταν, π.χ., αισθανθούν νιτρικά άλατα λοξοδρομούν σε πλάγιες προεκτάσεις. Εξαιρετικές τεχνικές, που έχουν σχέση με τη γεύση, αναπτύσσουν τα φυτά για να αντιμετωπίσουν και τις επιθέσεις εντόμων. Όταν ένα δάσος κωνοφόρων δέχεται επιδρομή από κάμπιες, τα δέντρα αρχίζουν να παράγουν βελόνες που είναι λιγότερο… νόστιμες και σχεδόν καθόλου θρεπτικές, με αποτέλεσμα να απομακρύνονται, έπειτα από τέσσερα πέντε χρόνια βέβαια, οι παρείσακτοι. Η οξιά όταν δέχεται επίθεση από ένα είδος ψείρας παρασκευάζει ουσίες που διακόπτουν την πέψη. Αυτές οι ψείρες εξαπλώνονται σε ολόκληρο το δέντρο, κάνοντας τους εισβολείς να μετανιώνουν για την επιλογή τους. Το πεύκο εκκρίνει ρετσίνι για να αναχαιτίσει τις επιθέσεις του σκολύτη, του εντόμου που σκάβει διαδρόμους κάτω από τον φλοιό του.
Οσμή: λειτουργεί σαν συναγερμός
Όταν τα φυτά βρίσκονται σε κίνδυνο, ένας αθόρυβος συναγερμός κτυπάει, μεταφέροντας αόρατα μηνύματα μέσω του αέρα. Μόνο μια ευαίσθητη μύτη θα μπορούσε να «πιάσει» την ύπαρξη μιας ιδιαίτερης οσμής. Η επίθεση από κάμπιες στην ιτιά προκαλεί χημικές μεταβολές στα άθικτα γειτονικά δέντρα. Το SOS μεταφέρεται μέσω του αιθυλενίου. Αυτό το πτητικό αέριο που συνοδεύει την ωρίμανση των φρούτων αναβλύζει από τους ερεθισμένους ή πληγωμένους ιστούς πολλών φυτών. Αποτέλεσμα είναι να ενεργοποιούνται διάφορες αμυντικές ουσίες, τόσο στα φυτά που έχουν δεχτεί την επίθεση όσο και στα γειτονικά που αισθάνονται το αιθυλένιο.
Δεν έχει αποδειχθεί ότι αγαπούν την Ενάτη
Παρά το ότι πολλοί λάτρεις των φυτών αναφέρονται με σιγουριά στη σχέση των φυτών με τη μουσική, μιλώντας για ευαισθησία που ξεπερνά ακόμα και εκείνη του κοινού της κλασικής μουσικής, η σχέση των φυτών με τη μουσική περισσότερο προσεγγίζεται μέσω της ανθρώπινης αντίληψης, παρά της επιστημονικής τεκμηρίωσης. Μέχρι τώρα τουλάχιστον. Πρόσφατες μελέτες βέβαια, επιβεβαίωσαν ότι ήχοι ελάχιστα πιο δυνατοί από την ανθρώπινη φωνή επιταχύνουν την ανάπτυξη ενός μπιζελιού - νάνου και τη βλάστηση των σπόρων του ραδικιού. Παρά το ότι οι επιστημονικές αποδείξεις σπανίζουν, δεν θα εκλείψουν οι φίλοι των φυτών που θα βάζουν την Ενάτη συμφωνία του Μπετόβεν, προσδοκώντας μια πιο ζωηρή ανάπτυξη ή έστω θέλοντας απλώς να κρατήσουν συντροφιά στους φυτεμένους φίλους τους.

Smell the risk, they do not hear Betoven, see colors, are shy and tasted with the roots. The five senses are not an exclusive privilege of animals. The plants grow in the "right" every time, just because they have similar senses. To survive measure During the day, control temperature and humidity. However, they feel ... senses? Animals are the network of blood veins, nervous system, etc. Plants; its unexplored field is slowly discovered by scientists. A whole world of moves, growth directions and metabolic changes are ultimately associated with sensitivities. In touch of touches are ... shyly. Just touching them "shimmering". In less than 1,000 species, the touch to the touch is immediate. The sarcophagus plant Closes his trap, Mimosa folds her sheets, nettle fractures her hairs causing us urticaria. In the vast majority of 240,000 flowering plants, Reactions are slow and limited. Any event that the plant is perceived as an attack, an electrical wave runs through the cell membrane. The ion flow alters the flexibility and the permeability of the membrane, as is also the case in human neurons. Calcium ions are flooded The interior of the cell. Calcium flow, suitable genes are activated, which are characterized as "touch genes" .Mimoses have a particular bumper of their stem, so-called and recreation. This instrument causes extremely fast Reactions - In Fractions of a second - in some touch or in light changes. Mimosa needs up to thirty minutes to return to its original position. They can talk about vision in plants? In a sense Yes, why plants do not They stand out only the intensity of light, but - through their pigments - they can also perceive its different Frequencies. Colors are two kinds: Phytochrome, sensitive to the shades of red and cryptochromes sensitized in blue. But see how they work: the plant is taking two different forms, depending on whether it outsreases dark or open Red in the rays that accept. Two forms are present at the same time, but in every period of 24 hours it prevails.In the light of the day, it is favored that its absorbency culminates in dark red. In particular, phytochrures favor the vegetation of seeds, prevent the trunk or shoot, activate the chlorophyll synthesis process. It is the plant to become robust, Leagues and green to the maximum of its capabilities. This changes if the plant is found in the shade, even in the shade of other plants. In this case the dye absorbs the light red and reflects the dark. So, the trunks are lengthened and tend to come out the shadow. "Overcome" that causes this competition and the constant hill of the took have negative effects on agriculture, since the overpayment for growth in height, delays the development of leaves, bulb and seeds. Sanding the flavor with the flavor roots also turns out Precious ally of plants. Roots, for example, intruding on the ground, are doomed to move in the dark. As the man Y has lost its vision develops other sensations, so the roots develop the flavor. When, e.g., they feel nitrates aside in lateral extensions. Equal techniques that are related to taste, develop plants to face and Insect attacks. When a conifer forest receives a caterpillars raid, the trees begin to produce needles that are less ... delicious and almost no nutrients, resulting in the exception of four years, the pours when it is attacked by Louse Prepares Substances that interrupt the digestion. These lice spread across the tree, making them invaders to regret their choice. Pine secretes resin to stop the scolyt attacks, the insect that digs corridors under his bark insect Alarm: Works like the plants are at risk, a silent alarm beats, transferring invisible messages through the air. Only a sensitive nose could "catch" the existence of a particular odor. Attack by caterpillars in the willow causes chemical changes in intact neighboring trees. SOS is transported through ethylene. This volatile gas accompanying fruit maturation is blowing from them Irritated or wounded tissues of many plants. It is possible to activate various defense substances, both in plants that have accepted the attack and adjacent to the ethylene.It has not been proven that they love it that many plant lovers are confidently mentioned in the relationship of plants with music, speaking for sensitivity that goes beyond the common of classical music, the relationship of plants with music more is approached through human perception, despite the scientific documentation. You are now at least. Subsequently, studies, of course, confirmed that sounds little stronger than human voice accelerate the development of a pea-dwarf and the vegetation of the seeds of horseradish. Plant friends are disappearing that will put the Neptan Agreement of Beethoven, expecting a more lively growth or even wanting to keep companionship on their planted friends.

They smell the danger, they don't listen to Beethoven, they see colors, they're shy and they taste with the roots.Five senses are not an exclusive privilege of animals.Plants grow in the “right” every time, precisely because they have similar senses.To survive they measure the length of the day, control the temperature and moisture.But how do they feel about senses?In animals there is the blood vein network, the nervous system, etc.The plants?This unsearchable field is slowly discovered by scientists.An entire world of movements, growth directions and metabolic changes is finally linked to the sensual sensations.They react to the touchPlants are... shy.As soon as we touch them, they're 'rethinking'.In less than 1,000 species, the reaction to touch is immediate.The carnivorous plant closes its trap, the mimosa folds its leaves, the nettle breaks its hair, causing us urticaria.However, in the vast majority of 240,000 flowers, the reactions are slow and limited.When an event occurs that the plant is perceived as an attack, an electrical wave runs through the cell membrane.The flow of ions alters the flexibility and permeability of the membrane, as is the case with human neurons.Calcium ions flood the inside of the cell.Appropriate genes, characterised as ‘ touch genes’, are activated alongside the calcium flow.Mimosses have a special mass odour block on the bottom of their leaves, the so-called and the capital.This instrument causes extremely rapid reactions - in fractions of the second - to a touch or to changes of light.The mimosa takes up to 30 minutes to return to its original position.They see colorsCan we talk about vision of plants?In a sense, yes, because plants do not only distinguish the intensity of light, but - through their colours - they can also perceive their different frequencies.The colours are of two kinds: plant colours, which are sensitive to the colours of the red and the crystals that are sensitive to the blue.But let's see how they work:The phytochrome takes two different forms depending on whether it outweighs dark or light red in the rays it accepts.The two forms are present at the same time, but at every 24 hours period some prevail.In the light of day, it favours the one whose absorption peaks in dark red.These plant dyes favour seed vegetation, prevent the prolongation of the torso or sprout, actuate the chlorophyll composition process.In other words, the plant is pushed into a firm, foliage and green to the maximum of its potential.This changes if the plant is found in the shadow, even in the shadow of other plants.In this case, the colouring matter absorbs open red and reflects dark.So the trunks prolong and tend to come out of the shadow.The "excession" caused by this competition and the constant heights of coagulation have negative effects on agriculture, since over-treating at heights delays the development of leaves, bulbs and seeds.Feel the taste of rootsTastes are also proven to be a valuable ally of plants.The roots, for example, that enter the ground, are doomed to move in darkness.As the man who has lost sight develops other senses, so roots develop taste.When, for example, nitrates feel stranded across sides.Excellent techniques, which relate to taste, develop plants to cope with insect attacks.When a coniferous forest is invaded by caterpillars, trees begin to produce needles that are less... delicious and almost no nutrients, resulting in the invaders being removed, after four five years.Acids when attacked by a kind of lice produce substances that stop digestion.These lice spread across the tree, causing invaders to regret their choice.The pine tree secretes retsini to block the attacks of the spoon, the insect that digs runways under its bark.Odor: works like an alarmWhen plants are in danger, a silent alarm strikes, transporting invisible messages through the air.Only a sensitive nose could "press" the existence of a special odor.The attack by caterpillars on the sea will cause chemical changes in intact neighboring trees.SOS is transported through ethylene.This volatile gas accompanying fruit maturation is eroded by the irritated or damaged tissues of many plants.As a result, various defensive substances are activated, both in the plants that have been attacked and in the adjacent ones that feel ethylene.There has been no evidence that they love Ninth.Although many plant worshipers refer with certainty to the relationship of plants with music, speaking of sensitivity that even goes beyond that of the audience of classical music, the relationship of plants with music is more closely approached through human perception than scientific documentation.So far, at least.Recent studies have, of course, confirmed that sounds little louder than human voice speed up the development of a pea- dwarf and vegetation of raki seeds.Although scientific evidence is rare, the plant friends who will put Beethoven’s Ninth deal will not disappear, looking for more lively growth or even just want to keep their planted friends together.

 Με 4:51  να μένουν στην κανονική διάρκεια, οι Καρολίνα Πάνθερς πήραν την κατοχή της μπάλας και ξεκίνησαν από την δική τους γραμμή 24 γιαρδών, με την ευκαιρία να ξεκινήσουν μια νικηφόρα επίθεση στο παιχνίδι και γρήγορα ήρθαν αντιμέτωποι με την 3η προσπάθεια και 9 γιάρδες. Στο επόμενο play, ο Miller έχασε την μπάλα από τον Newton και μετά  αρκετοί παίχτες βούτηξαν για την μπάλα, αυτή έκανε μια μεγάλη αναπήδηση προ τα πίσω και ανακτήθηκε από τον Ward, που την επέστρεψε 5 γιάρδες, στην 4-yard line των Πάνθερς. Παρά το γεγονός ότι αρκετοί παίκτες βούτηξαν σε μια προσπάθεια να ανακτήσουν την μπάλα, ο Newton δεν το έκανε και η έλλειψη επιθετικότητας έφερε αργότερα αρκετή κριτική. Εν τω μεταξύ, η επίθεση της Ντένβερ κρατήθηκε μακριά από την end zone για τρία plays, αλλά ένα πέναλτι από κράτημα στον cornerback  Josh Norman έδωσε την ευκαιρία στους Μπρόνκος για δυο νέα downs . Στη συνέχεια, ο Anderson  σκόραρε ένα 2-yard touchdown και ο Manning ολοκλήρωσε μια πάσα στον Bennie Fowler για μια μετατροπή 2-πόντων, δίνοντας στους Ντένβερ ένα προβάδισμα  24–10, με 3:08 να μένουν στο ρολόι, και ουσιαστικά καθάρισε το παιχνίδι. Οι Καρολίνα Πάνθερς είχαν ακόμα δυο επιθέσεις, αλλά δεν μπόρεσαν να πάρουν ένα first down σε καμία από αυτές.

At the next play, Miller lost the ball from Newton and then several players were blowing for the ball, she did a big bounce before back and recovered by Ward, returning 5 yards, at 4-Yard Line of Pancherz. Despite the fact that several players threw in an effort to regain the ball, Newton did not and the lack of aggression was later criticized. Meanwhile, Denver's attack was held away from End Zone for three plays, but a criminal penalty to Cornerback Josh Norman gave Bronos the opportunity for two new downs. Then Anderson scored a 2-Yard TouchDown and Manning completed a Bennie Fowler for a 2-point conversion, giving Denver a 24-10 lead, with 3:08 to stay on the clock, and virtually cleansed the game Tained. Carolina Pancherz had two more attacks, but they were unable to take a First Down to none of them.

 Σε κοντινή απόσταση, στο Ogród Saski (το Πάρκο της Σαξονίας), το Θερινό Θέατρο ήταν σε λειτουργία από το 1870 έως το 1939 και στη μεσοπολεμική περίοδο το θεατρικό συγκρότημα περιελάμβανε επίσης το πρώτο λογοτεχνικό καμπαρέ της Βαρσοβίας, το Momus, και το μουσικό θέατρο του Λεόν Σίλλερ, Melodram. Το θέατρο Wojciech Bogusławski (1922-26), ήταν το καλύτερο παράδειγμα «μνημειώδους θεάτρου της Πολωνίας». Από τα μέσα της δεκαετίας του 1930, το κτίριο του Great Theatre στεγάζει το Ίνστιτούτο Δραματικών Τεχνών Upati —την πρώτη Κρατική Ακαδημία Δραματικής Τέχνης, με τμήμα ηθοποιίας και τμήμα σκηνοθεσίας.

 Καθ' όλη τη διάρκεια της ύπαρξής της, η Βαρσοβία υπήρξε μια πολυ-πολιτισμική πόλη. Σύμφωνα με την απογραφή του 1901, από τους 711.988 κατοίκους το 56,2% ήταν Καθολικοί, 35,7% Εβραίοι, 5% Έλληνες Χριστιανοί ορθόδοξοι και 2,8% Προτεστάντες. Οκτώ χρόνια αργότερα, το 1909, ήταν 281.754 Εβραίοι (36,9%), 18.189 Προτεστάντες (2,4%) και 2.818 Mariavites (0,4%). Αυτό οδήγησε στην κατασκευή εκατοντάδων τόπων θρησκευτικής λατρείας σε κάθε σημείο της πόλης. Οι περισσότεροι από αυτούς καταστράφηκαν μετά την Εξέγερση της Βαρσοβίας το 1944. Μετά τον πόλεμο, οι νέες κομμουνιστικές αρχές της Πολωνίας αποθάρρυναν την κατασκευή εκκλησιών και μόνο ένας μικρός αριθμός ξαναχτίστηκε.

 Η βασική μονάδα εδαφικής διαίρεσης στην Πολωνία είναι η κοινότητα (gmina). Μια πόλη είναι επίσης μια κοινότητα - αλλά με βάση τον χάρτη της πόλης. Και οι δύο, πόλεις και κοινότητες, διοικούνται από τον δήμαρχο, αλλά στις κοινότητες ο δήμαρχος είναι vogt (wojt στα πολωνικά), ενώ για τις πόλεις είναι burmistrz. Ορισμένες από τις μεγαλύτερες πόλεις αποκτούν δικαιώματα, δηλαδή καθήκοντα και προνόμια, τα οποία ανήκουν σε μονάδες της δεύτερης βαθμίδας της εδαφικής διαίρεσης – κομητείες ή powiats. Ένα παράδειγμα αυτού του δικαιώματος είναι η έκδοση άδειας κυκλοφορίας αυτοκινήτου. Οι gmina δεν μπορούν να εκδώσουν άδειες κυκλοφορίες, αυτό είναι στην δικαιοδοσία των powiat (δηλαδή, ο αριθμός άδειας κυκλοφορίας εξαρτάται από το powiat στο οποίο έχει καταχωρηθεί το αυτοκίνητο, όχι το gmina). Σε αυτή την περίπτωση μιλάμε για πόλη κομητεία ή powiat grodzki. Τέτοιες πόλεις είναι για παράδειγμα το Λούμπλιν, η Κρακοβία, το Γκντανσκ, το Πόζναν. Στη Βαρσοβία, οι περιφέρειες της πόλης έχουν επιπλέον ορισμένα από τα δικαιώματα των powiat — όπως την έκδοση αδειών κυκλοφορίας αυτοκινήτων, που αναφέρθηκε ήδη. Για παράδειγμα, η περιφέρεια Wola έχει τα δικά της στοιχεία και η περιφέρεια Ursynów πάλι τα δικά της (και τα αυτοκίνητα από την Wola έχουν άλλο τύπο άδειας κυκλοφορίας από αυτόν της Ursynów). Αλλά, για παράδειγμα, οι περιφέρειες στην Κρακοβία δεν έχουν τα δικαιώματα των powiat, κι έτσι οι αριθμοί κυκλοφορίας στην Κρακοβία είναι του ίδιου τύπου για όλες τις περιοχές.

The Basic Territorial Division Unit in Poland is the Community (GMINA). A city is also a community - but based on the city map. Both, cities and communities are managed by the mayor, but in the Communities the Mayor is Vogt (Wojt in Polish), while for cities are Burmistrz. Some of the largest cities acquire rights, ie tasks and privileges, which belong to units of the second tier of territorial division - counties or Powiats. An example of this right is to issue a car marketing authorization. Gmina can not issue empty releases, this is in Powiat's jurisdiction (ie, the marketing authorization number depends on Powiat who has registered the car, not GMINA). In this case we are talking about County City or Powiat Grodzki. Such cities are, for example, Lublin, Krakow, Gdansk, Poznan. In Warsaw, the city regions additionally have some of Powiat's rights - such as the issue of car traffic licenses already mentioned. For example, the WOLA region has its own elements and the ursynów region again its own (and cars from WOLA have another type of marketing authorization from that of Ursynów). But, for example, regions in Krakow do not have Powiat's rights, so the circulation numbers in Krakow are of the same type for all areas.

Προγενέστεροι άποικοι Βίκινγκς είχαν αρχίσει να καταφθάνουν στα 880, αλλά χωρίστηκαν μεταξύ αποικιών στην ανατολή (Roumois και Pays de Caux) γύρω από την κοιλάδα του Σηκουάνα και στα δυτικά στην χερσόνησο Κοταντέν, και χωρίστηκαν από τους παραδοσιακούς pagii, των οποίων ο πληθυσμός παρέμεινε σχεδόν ο ίδιος, με κανέναν σχεδόν ξένο έποικο. Οι ομάδες του Ρόλλο, που επιτέθηκαν και τελικά εγκαταστάθηκαν στη Νορμανδία και τις περιοχές της ακτής του Ατλαντικού, αποτελούνταν από Δανούς, Νορβηγούς, Νορμανδούς-Κέλτες, Orkney Βίκινγκς, ενδεχομένως Σουηδούς και Αγγλο-Δανούς από την αγγλική Danelaw υπό Νορμανδικό έλεγχο.

Prior to the arrival of the role, the populations did not differ from those of Picardy or Il-de-France, who were considered "Franks". Previous Vikings settlers had begun to arrive at 880, but were divided between colonies in the East (Roumois and Pays de Caux) around the Seine Valley and to the west in Kotanden Peninsula, and were divided by traditional Pagii, whose population remained almost the himself, with any almost foreign sediment. The teams of the Rell, who attacked and finally settled in Normandy and the Atlantic coastal regions, consisted of Danish, Norwegian, Normans-Celts, Orkney Vikings, possibly Swedish and English-Danes from English Danelaw under Norman control.

Η οικογένεια Drengot έκτοτε ανέλαβε το πριγκιπάτο της Κάπουα και ο αυτοκράτορας Ερρίκος ΙΙΙ έδωσε τίτλο ευγενείας "dux et magister Italiae comesque Normannorum totius Apuliae et Calabriae" («ο Δούκας και Κύριος της Ιταλίας και Κόμης των Νορμανδών όλης της Απουλίας και της Καλαβρίας») στον αρχηγό των Hauteville, Ντρόγκο το 1047.

The Hauteville family received a princely degree, with the prince of Guaimar IV of Salerno "Duke of Apulia and Calabria". Immediately awarded their elected leader, William Iron Arm the title of Coros in the Capital of Melf. The DRENGOT family has since took over the Principality of Sea and Emperor Henry III gave a nobility title "Dux Et Magister Italiae Comesque Normnorum Totius Apuliae et Calabriae" ("Doukas and Lord of Italy and Norman of Normans all of Apulia and Calabria") Hauteville leader, Drugo in 1047.

 Αμέσως μετά, οι Νορμανδοί άρχισαν να εισέρχονται στην Ιταλία, μπήκαν στη Βυζαντινή Αυτοκρατορία και, στη συνέχεια, στην Αρμενία, πολεμώντας εναντίον των Πετσενέγων, των Βουλγάρων, και ειδικά των Σελτζούκων Τούρκων. Οι Νορμανδοί μισθοφόροι αρχικά παρακινήθηκαν προς τον νότο από τους Λομβαρδούς για να πολεμήσουν κατά των Βυζαντινών, αλλά σύντομα βρέθηκαν να πολεμούν για το Βυζάντιο στη Σικελία. Η συμβολή τους ήταν σημαντική, μαζί με αυτή των Βαράγγων και των Λομβαρδών, στη Σικελική εκστρατεία του Γεωργίου Μανιάκη το 1038-40. Υπάρχει μια συζήτηση για το αν οι Νορμανδοί στην ελληνική πλευρά ήταν στην πραγματικότητα από τη Νορμανδική Ιταλία, και απ' ότι φαίνεται πλέον μόνο λίγοι προέρχονταν από εκεί. Είναι επίσης άγνωστο πόσοι από τους «Φράγκους», όπως τους αποκαλούσαν οι Βυζαντινοί, ήταν Νορμανδοί και όχι άλλοι Γάλλοι.

Norman mercenaries were initially motivated to the south of the Lombards to fight against Byzantines, but soon they were found to fight for Byzantium in Sicily. Their contribution was important, along with that of Veraces and Lombardies, in the Sicilian Campaign of Georgios Maniaki in 1038-40. There is a debate on whether the Normans on the Greek side were in fact from Norman Italy, and than just seems only a few came from there. It is also unknown how many of the "Franks", as the Byzantines called them, they were Norman and not other French.

 Κάποιοι Νορμανδοί συστρατεύτηκαν με τις Τουρκικές δυνάμεις για την καταστροφή των υποτελών περιοχών της Αρμενίας Sassoun και Taron στα βάθη της Ανατολίας. Αργότερα, πολλοί συντάχτηκαν με το Βασίλειο της Αρμενίας νοτιότερα στην Κιλικία και την οροσειρά του Ταύρου. Ο Νορμανδός Oursel οδηγήσε τους «Φράγκους» στην κοιλάδα του Ευφράτη, στη βόρεια Συρία. Από το 1073 ως το 1074, οι  8.000 από τους 20.000 στρατιώτες του αρμενικού στρατεύματος Philaretus Brachamius ήταν Νορμανδοί— προηγουμένως υπό τον Oursel— με αρχηγό τον Raimbaud. Δάνεισαν την εθνικότητά τους ακόμα και στο όνομα του κάστρου τους: Afranji, που σημαίνει «Φράγκοι». Το γνωστό εμπόριο μεταξύ Αμάλφι και Αντιοχείας και μεταξύ Μπάρι και Ταρσού μπορεί να σχετίζεται με την παρουσία Ιταλο-Νορμανδών σε αυτές τις πόλεις, αφού το Αμάλφι και το Μπάρι ήταν υπό νορμανδική κυριαρχία στην Ιταλία.

Since 1073 to 1074, 8,000 of the 20,000 soldiers of the Philaretus Brachamius Armenian troop were Norman - previously under Oursel- with the leader Raimbaud. They lent their nationality even in the name of their Castle: Afranji, which means "Franks". The well-known trade between Amalfi and Antioch and between Bari and Tarsus can be related to the presence of Italian-Normans in these cities, since Amalfi and Bari were under Norseland domination in Italy.

Αυτή ήταν η αρχή μιας διαμάχης ετών γύρω από τα διπλώματα ευρεσιτεχνίας στα ραδιοκύματα, με τις πατέντες του Τέσλα να επικυρώνονται το 1903 και να ακολουθεί μια αντίστροφη απόφαση υπέρ του Μαρκόνι το 1904.

Το δικαστήριο έκρινε ότι η απόφαση δεν είχε καμία σχέση με τον ισχυρισμό του Μαρκόνι ότι εφηύρε πρώτος την ραδιοφωνική μετάδοση, απλώς ότι εφόσον η διεκδίκηση του Μαρκόνι για ορισμένα διπλώματα ευρεσιτεχνίας ήταν αμφίβολη, δεν θα μπορούσε να ισχυριστεί παραβίαση των διπλωμάτων ευρεσιτεχνίας (υπάρχουν ισχυρισμοί ότι το ανώτατο δικαστήριο προσπαθούσε να αναιρέσει μια αξίωση από τον πρώτο Παγκόσμιο Πόλεμο κατά της κυβέρνησης των ΗΠΑ από την Εταιρεία Μαρκόνι, αποκαθιστώντας απλώς το προηγούμενο δίπλωμα ευρεσιτεχνίας του Τέσλα).

In 1900, patents were given to the "Electricity Transmission" and "an electric transmitter". When William Markos made the famous first transatlantic radio broadcast in 1901, Tesla said that this was done with 17 Tesla patents, although there is no enough evidence to support this allegation. This was the beginning of a controversy of patents in the radio waves, with Tesla patents to be validated in 1903 and follow a reverse decision in favor of the Mark in 1904. In 1943, a US Supreme Court decision restored the previous patents Tesla, Oliver Lodz, and John Store. The Court held that the decision had nothing to do with the merger of the Markna that he invited radio broadcasting, simply that since the twisting of the marcue for certain patents was doubtful, he could not claim a breach of patents (there are allegations that the Supreme Court was trying to set aside a claim from the First World War against the US Government by Marconi, by simply restoring Tesla patent merely).

In 1900 the Tesla patents were awarded for a ‘electricity transmission’ and ‘an electrical transmitter’.When William Marconi made the famous first transatlantic broadcasting of radio waves in 1901, Tesla said kindly saying that this was done with 17 Tesla patents, although there is not enough evidence to support this claim.This was the beginning of a controversy of years around the patents in radio waves, with Tesla's patents validated in 1903 and a reverse decision in favour of Marconi in 1904.In 1943, a U.S. Supreme Court judgment restored previous Tesla, Oliver Lodge, and John Stone patents.The court considered that the decision had nothing to do with Marconi's claim that he was the first to invent radio broadcasting, simply that since Markoni's claim for certain patents was questionable, it could not claim a violation of the patents (there are claims that the supreme court was trying to undo a claim against the first World War against the US Government by the Markoni Company simply by restoring Tesla's earlier patent).

 Στα χρόνια που ακολούθησαν μετά από αυτές τις φήμες, ούτε ο Τέσλα ούτε ο Έντισον κέρδισε το βραβείο (αν και ο Έντισον έλαβε μία από τις 38 υποψηφιότητες το 1915 και ο Tesla έλαβε μία από τις 38 υποψηφιότητες το 1937).

 Ωστόσο, οι θρησκευτικές του απόψεις παραμένουν αβέβαιες λόγω άλλων δηλώσεων που έκανε. Για παράδειγμα, στο άρθρο του, "Α Machine to End War",  που δημοσιεύθηκε το 1937, ο Tesla δήλωσε:
